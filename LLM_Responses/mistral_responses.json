For\nexample,101is not a jamcoin; its interpretation in base 2 is 5,\nwhich is prime. But the string1001is a jamcoin: in bases 2\nthrough 10, its interpretation is 9, 28, 65, 126, 217, 344, 513, 730, and 1001,\nrespectively, and none of those is prime.\nWe hear that there may be communities that use jamcoins as a form of currency.\nWhen sending someone a jamcoin, it is polite to prove that the jamcoin is\nlegitimate by including a nontrivial divisor of that jamcoin's interpretation\nin each base from 2 to 10. (A nontrivial divisor for a positive integerKis some positive integer other than 1 orKthat evenly dividesK.) For convenience, these divisors must be expressed in base 10.\nFor example, for the jamcoin1001mentioned above, a possible set\nof nontrivial divisors for the base 2 through 10 interpretations of the jamcoin\nwould be: 3, 7, 5, 6, 31, 8, 27, 5, and 77, respectively.\nCan you produceJdifferent jamcoins of lengthN, along with\nproof that they are legitimate?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow; each consists of one line with two integersNandJ.\nFor each test case, outputJ+1 lines. The first line must consist of\nonlyCase #x:, wherexis the test case number\n(starting from 1). Each of the lastJlines must consist of a jamcoin of\nlengthNfollowed by nine integers. The i-th of those nine integers\n(counting starting from 1) must be a nontrivial divisor of the jamcoin when\nthe jamcoin is interpreted in base i+1.\nAll of these jamcoins must be different. You cannot submit the same jamcoin\nin two different lines, even if you use a different set of divisors each time.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.T= 1. (There will be only one test case.)It is guaranteed that at leastJdistinct jamcoins of lengthNexist.\nN= 16.J= 50.\nN= 32.J= 500.\nNote that, unusually for a Code Jam problem, you already know the exact\ncontents of each input file. For example, the Small dataset's input file will\nalways be exactly these two lines:\nSo, you can consider doing some computation before actually downloading an\ninput file and starting the clock.\nIn this sample case, we have used very small values ofNandJfor ease of explanation. Note that this sample case would not appear in either\nthe Small or Large datasets.\nThis is only one of multiple valid solutions. Other sets of jamcoins could have\nbeen used, and there are many other possible sets of nontrivial base 10\ndivisors. Some notes:\n",

Since you were in a hurry when you\nhired them, you did not check whether they actually know how to operate your machines. Now you have\nfinally asked them, and so you have the information on whether the i-th worker\ncan operate the j-th machine, for each i and j.\nIn a typical working day, the workers will arrive at the factory in a random order,\nwhich can be different each day.\nAs each worker arrives, they will find all machines that they know how to operate and that do not\nalready have an operator. They will choose one of those at random\nand operate it for the whole working day.\n If all machines they know how to operate already have an operator, they will not work that day.\n Your goal is to make sure that all machines are being operated each working\nday, regardless of what order the workers arrive in and which machines they choose.\nFor example, suppose there are two workers A and B, and two machines 1 and 2. Suppose\nthat A knows how to operate 1 and 2, and B knows how to operate 1 but not 2.\nIf worker B arrives first, he will pick machine 1, then when worker A arrives she will have\nto choose 2, and the factory will work well. However, if worker A arrives first,\nit might happen that she chooses to operate 1 on that day, and then when worker B arrives\nhe does not have anything to do, leaving machine 2 without an operator, and causing\nyour factory to waste a whole day!\nAs another example, suppose there are two workers A and B, and two machines 1 and 2,\nand that A knows how to operate 1 but not 2, and B does not know how to operate anything. Then,\nregardless of the order in which the workers arrive, the factory will not be able to function well.\nBefore you open your factory, in order to guarantee that the factory will\nconstantly function well, you can teach your workers how to operate machines.\nIt costs one dollar to give a single worker a lesson on how to operate a single\nmachine.

There is only one worker, and the\nworker already knows how to operate the one machine.\nIn sample case #5, worker B already knows how to operate machines 1 and 2. One\noptimal strategy is to teach worker A to operate machine 3, and make A the only\nworker who can operate that machine.

For any cell, there are two possible kinds of hedge: lower left to\nupper right, which we represent with/, and upper left to lower\nright, which we represent with\\. Wherever two hedges touch, they\nform a continuous wall.\nAround the courtyard is an outer ring of unit cells, one cell wide, with the\nfour corners missing.

The Code Jam team wants to push these goals to the limit, so\nwe are proposing a new language called Go++.\nThe Go++ language uses one register, which stores one boolean value (0 or 1).\nThis register is initialized to 0. The language has three instructions:0, which sets the register to 0.1, which sets the register to 1.?, which prints the current register value.Simple, right? To support multi-threading, we allow two different Go++ programs\nto run simultaneously while sharing the one register. Each instruction executes\natomically \u2014 that is, one instruction must completely finish before the\nnext instruction can start. However, the two programs may be interleaved in any\nway that preserves the relative order within each program.\nFor example, here are the only six ways in which the two programs1?and?0could be executed together.

        "prompt_text": "You are a rebel against the evil Galactic Empire, and you are on the run!\nYou have sabotaged the Empire's Factory of Evil, and imperial security\nforces will be after you soon! The factory is located on asteroid 0 in a system\nofNnumbered asteroids. Your getaway ship, the Century Quail, is\nlocated on asteroid 1, and if you can get there, you will be able to fly away\nsafely.\nEach asteroid is a single point in space with a velocity, and you move through\nspace along with whichever asteroid you are currently on. Your Asteroid Jumper\nwill allow you to instantaneously jump between any two asteroids in the system.\nLong jumps are scarier than short ones (and the vacuum of space is terrifying),\nso you want to minimize the maximum distance you need to jump. However,\nstarting now, if you ever spend more than a continuousSseconds without\njumping, the imperial security forces will catch you. That is, the interval\nfrom now until your first jump, and each interval between subsequent jumps,\nmust be less than or equal toS. You may jump atanyinstant;\nit does not have to be after an integer number of seconds have elapsed. You\nescape the instant you jump to asteroid 1.\nThe i-th asteroid starts at position (xi,yi,zi) in space, and it will move a\ntotal distance of (Vxi,Vyi,Vzi) each second. This movement is continuous throughout time;\nit does not update discretely each second. (It is also possible for an\nasteroid to be stationary.) Nothing happens if asteroids occupy the same point\nin space at the same time. You can only travel between two asteroids by\njumping, even if they happen to occupy the same point at the instant of your\njump.\nIn the escape plan that minimizes the maximum jump distance, what is that\nmaximum jump distance?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers:N(the number of asteroids) andS(the limit on how long you can\ngo without jumping). Next, there areNlines describing the asteroids.\nThe i-th of these lines (counting starting from 0) contains six integers: the\ninitial (xi,yi,zi)\nposition of the i-th asteroid in space, and the distance (Vxi,Vyi,Vzi) it moves\nin a single second.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis\na floating-point number: the distance of the longest jump you will have to make\nin order to get away.ywill be considered correct if it is within\nan absolute or relative error of 10-4of the correct answer. See theFAQfor an\nexplanation of what that means, and what formats of real numbers we accept.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 \u2264T\u2264 20.2 \u2264N\u2264 1000.1 \u2264S\u2264 100.-500 \u2264xi\u2264 500.-500 \u2264yi\u2264 500.-500 \u2264zi\u2264 500.\nVxi= 0.Vyi= 0.Vzi= 0.\n\nSample case #1 is the only sample case that could appear in the Small dataset.\nAny of the sample cases could appear in the Large dataset.\nIn sample case #1, we start on a stationary asteroid at (0, 0, 0), and our ship\nis on an asteroid at (1, 2, 2). There is another asteroid at (1, 1, 1). One\noption is to jump directly to our ship, which is a distance of 3 away. Another\noption is to jump to the other asteroid, which is a distance of sqrt(3) away,\nand then jump to the ship from there, which is a distance of sqrt(2) away. The\nmaximum jump distance is 3 for the first option and sqrt(3) for the second\noption, so the second option is preferable.\nNote that the value ofSdoes not matter in the Small cases. Since all\nof the asteroids are stationary, there is no reason to wait around; we can make\nall jumps instantaneously.\nIn sample case #2, we start on a stationary asteroid at (0, 0, 0). We can wait\nthere for 4 seconds for asteroid 4 to come very close, jump onto it, fly for 1\nsecond on it, and then jump back at time 5 back to asteroid 0 (the distance\nbetween the two asteroids is 1 at this moment). There we wait 10 seconds,\ncutting it very close to being caught, and then jump to the speeding asteroid 3\nat time 15. Two seconds later, asteroid 3 flies by asteroid 2, and we jump to\nasteroid 2. At time 27, we can jump from asteroid 2 to asteroid 0. There we\npatiently wait until time 35 when asteroid 1 reaches us, then we can jump onto\nit and escape.\nThe longest jump we made was from asteroid 0 to asteroid 3 at time 15, and the\ndistance we jumped was 2.\nIn sample case #3, the security forces are really active! You could, of course,\nwait one second and jump directly to asteroid 1, but a better choice - that\nallows you to make jumps no longer than 4 - is to jump back and forth between\nasteroids 0 and 2; while waiting for asteroid 1 to get close, and only then\njump to it.\n",

For instance, the shortest\npath in the above example takes 17 steps.\nBeing such a clever mapmaker, Ben realized that he has created a map that is too\nhard for his friends to solve. He would like to reduce its difficulty by\nremoving some of the impassable walls. In particular, he wants to know whether\nit is possible to remove zero or more impassable walls from his map such that\nthe shortest path from start to finish takesexactlyDsteps, and\nthat the resulting map is stillgood. Note that it is not enough to\nsimply findapath withDsteps;Dmust be the number of\nsteps in theshortestpath.\nFor example, ifD= 15, we could remove the impassable wall directly\nbelow the finish position to get a good solution.\nThere is no solution ifD= 5.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing three\nspace-separated integersR,CandD: the number of rows and\ncolumns in the map, and the desired number of steps in the shortest path from\nstart to finish after possibly removing impassable walls.Rlines follow,\neach consisting ofCcharacters (either.,#,SorF) representing Ben's map.\nIt is guaranteed that the map is good, as described in the problem statement.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis\nthe wordPOSSIBLEorIMPOSSIBLE, depending on whether\nthe shortest path can be made equal toDby removing some number of walls\nsuch that the map is still good.

However, there is no way to make the\ndistance of the shortest path exactly 3.\nIn sample case #3, the shortest path already takes 11 steps to begin with, so\nthere is no need to reduce the difficulty of the map.\n",

You know which ingredients to use, and how many grams of each one to\n  use, in order to make one serving of ratatouille. But you believe that anyone\n  can cook, and so you want to share the recipe with the world... and make some\n  money in the process!\nYou have ordered some ingredient packages that are easy to ship. Each package\n  contains some amount of one ingredient; different packages may have different\n  amounts even if they contain the same ingredient. For convenience, you\n  ordered the same number of packages of each ingredient.\nYou would like to use these packages to form as many ratatouillekitsas possible to send to customers. A kit consists ofexactly onepackage of each ingredient, and a label with the integer number of servings\n  of ratatouille that the kit makes. Since you do not want to shortchange\n  customers or waste food, each package must contain between 90 and 110 percent\n  (inclusive) of the amount of that ingredient that is actually needed to make\n  the number of servings of ratatouille on the kit's label.\nFor example, suppose that one serving of ratatouille takes 500 g of tomato\n  and 300 g of onion. Suppose that you have a 900 g package of tomato and a\n  660 g package of onion. You could form these into a kit that makes two\n  servings of ratatouille. To make two servings, 1000 g of tomato and 600 g of\n  onion are required. Since the 900 g of tomato you have is within [90, 110]%\n  of the 1000 g of tomato required, and the 660 g of onion you have is within\n  [90, 110]% of the 600 g of onion required, this is acceptable. However, you\n  could not say that the kit makes one or three servings of ratatouille, nor\n  could you say that it makes 1.999 servings (the number of servings must be\n  an integer).\nNote that there are some sets of packages that could never form a kit.\n  Continuing with our recipe above, if you have a 1500 g package of tomato and\n  an 809 g package of onion, for example, there is no amount of servings that\n  you can make. Three servings would take 1500 g of tomato and 900 g of onion,\n  and the amount of onion is not within the [90, 110]% range. No other integer\n  amount of servings works, either.\nYou want to share your recipe with as many customers as possible, so you want\n  to produce the maximum number of valid kits. (Of course, each package can be\n  used in at most one kit.) What is the largest number of kits that you can\n  form? Note that you arenotrequired to maximize the total number of\n  servings of ratatouille formed.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each case consists of the following:\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the maximum number of kits you can produce, as described above.\nMemory limit: 1 GB.1 \u2264T\u2264 100.1 \u2264Ri\u2264 106, for all i.1 \u2264Qij\u2264 106, for all i and j.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.1 \u2264N\u2264 2.1 \u2264P\u2264 8.\nTime limit: 120 seconds.1 \u2264N\u2264 50.1 \u2264P\u2264 50.N\u00d7P\u2264 1000.\nNote that the last sample case would not appear in the Small dataset.Sample cases #1 and #2 are the ones described in the problem statement.\n\nIn sample case #3, you can form a kit out of the 450 g package of the first\n  ingredient and the 1100 g package of the second ingredient, and say that the\n  kit makes 10 servings of ratatouille. That number of servings requires 500 g\n  of the first ingredient; you have 450 g, which is 90% of 500 and within the\n  allowed limit. It requires 1000 g of the second ingredient; you have 1100 g,\n  which is 110% of 1000 and within the allowed limit.\nOnce you form this kit, however, you cannot form the remaining packages into\n  a kit. 449 g of the first ingredient and 1101 g of the second ingredient\n  would not be able to form 10 (or any other number of) servings. In fact, the\n  (450 g, 1100 g) kit is the only kit that can be formed from these packages.\nIn sample case #4, no kits can be formed. Note that the recipe requires\n  particular amounts of particular ingredientsin the given order; the\n  ingredients are not interchangeable. This is fine French cuisine, after all!\nIn sample case #5, the recipe has only one ingredient \u2014 how elegantly\n  simple! A single serving cannot use more than 11 g, and two servings cannot\n  use fewer than 18 g. It is possible to form three kits: two with an 11 g\n  package, and one with an 18 g package.\nIn sample case #6, you can form three valid kits: (700 g, 800 g, 900 g),\n  which makes 10 servings, and (1500 g, 1600 g, 1700 g) and (1260 g, 1440 g,\n  1620 g), each of which makes 20 servings. Note that you could also say that\n  the (1260 g, 1440 g, 1620 g) kit makes 17, 18, or 19 servings, but it does\n  not matter how many servings a kit makes as long as the kit is valid.\n",

It sorts the ingredients in ascending order and initializes a variable `max_servings` to 0.\n\nNext, it iterates through all possible numbers of servings from 1 up to the minimum of the number of ingredients or the total number of servings required for one full serving (N). For each potential number of servings, it calculates the required amount of each ingredient for that number of servings and checks if the packages have enough of each ingredient within the allowed range. If they do, it updates `max_servings` to be the maximum of its current value and the potential number of servings.\n\nFinally, it prints the result for the current test case as 'Case #x: y', where x is the test case number and y is the maximum number of kits that can be formed.",

So, the three options, with their total\n  times, are:\nIn Case #3, there are lots of alternatives for each delivery. The optimal one\n  for the first delivery (city 2 to city 4) is to go to city 1 in time 10/1000,\n  change horses, and then go to cities 2, 3 and 4, in that order, using the\n  horse from city 1, which takes time (10 + 10 + 10) / 60.\nFor the second delivery (city 3 to city 2) you have no choice but to first go\n  to city 4 which takes time 10/5. Your relatively fast horse does not have\n  enough endurance to get anywhere else, so you need to grab the horse in city\n  4. You could use it to get directly to city 1 in time 15, but that would be\n  slower than riding it to city 2 in time 6 and then using the blazingly fast\n  horse in city 2 to get to city 1 in just 10/1000 extra time.\nIn the third delivery (city 3 to city 1) of Case #3 it is optimal to use the\n  first two steps of the previous one, for a total time of 10/5 + 6 = 8.\n",

The probability that both cores fail is (1 - 0.9) \u00d7\n  (1 - 0.8) = 0.02.

They have\n  been equal partners their whole relationship, and they do not want to stop\n  now, so they decided that each of them will be in charge for exactly 12\n  hours (720 minutes) per day.\nCameron and Jamie have other activities that they either need or want to\n  do on their own. Cameron hasACof these and Jamie hasAJ. These activities always take place at the same times\n  each day. None of Cameron's activities overlap with Jamie's activities, so at\n  least one of the parents will always be free to take care of the baby.\nCameron and Jamie want to come up with a daily baby care schedule such that:\nFor example, suppose that Jamie and Cameron have a single activity each:\n  Jamie has a morning activity from 9 am to 10 am, and Cameron has an afternoon\n  activity from 2 pm to 3 pm. One possible but suboptimal schedule would be for\n  Jamie to take care of the baby from midnight to 6 am and from noon to 6 pm,\n  and for Cameron to take care of the baby from 6 am to noon and 6 pm to\n  midnight. That fulfills the first two conditions, and requires a total of 4\n  exchanges, which happen at midnight, 6 am, noon and 6 pm. If there is an\n  exchange happening at midnight, it is counted exactly once, not zero or two\n  times.\nA better option would be for Cameron to take care of the baby from midnight\n  to noon, and Jamie to take care of the baby from noon to midnight. This\n  schedule also fulfills the first two conditions, but it uses only 2\n  exchanges, which is the minimum possible.\nGiven Cameron's and Jamie's lists of activities, and the restrictions above,\n  what is the minimum possible number of exchanges in a daily schedule?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

No\n  matter how the parents divide up the remaining 1438 non-activity minutes of\n  the day, there must be at least one exchange from Jamie to Cameron, and there\n  is no reason to add more exchanges than that.\nIn Case #4, note that back-to-back activities can exist for the same partner\n  or different partners.

The chocolate to be given away comes in packs ofPpieces. You would like to open new packs for each tour group, but\n  the owner insists that if there are leftover pieces from one group, they must\n  be used with the next tour group before opening up any new packs.\nFor instance, suppose that each pack containsP=3 pieces, and that a\n  tour group with 5 people comes. You will open two packs to give one piece to\n  each person, and you will have one piece left over. Suppose that after that,\n  another tour group with 6 people comes.

People are\n  happy that love and peace have returned.\nThe city is represented as a grid withRrows andCcolumns.\n  Some cells on the grid are buildings (through which nobody can see, nobody can\n  shoot, and nobody can walk), and some are streets (through which everybody can\n  see, shoot and walk). Unfortunately, during the war, the now-defeated\n  invaders set up automatic security turrets in the city. These turrets are only\n  in streets (not in buildings). They pose a threat to the citizens, but\n  fortunately, there are also some soldiers on the streets (not in buildings).\n  Initially, no soldier is in the same place as a turret.\nThe invader turrets do not move. They are small, so they don't block sight and\n  shooting. A soldier cannot walk through an active turret's cell, but can walk\n  through it once it is destroyed. A turret can only see soldiers in the cells\n  for which it has a horizontal or vertical line of sight. If a soldier enters\n  such a cell, the turret does not fire. If a soldier attempts to exit such a\n  cell (after entering it, or after starting in that cell),\n  the turret fires. Luckily, a soldier can still shoot from that cell,\n  and the turret will not detect that as movement. It means that none of your\n  soldiers will actually die, because in the worst case they can always wait,\n  motionless, for help (perhaps for a long time). Maybe you will have a chance\n  to rescue them later.\nEach soldier can make a total ofMunit moves. Each of these moves must\n  be one cell in a horizontal or vertical direction. Soldiers can walk through\n  each other and do not block the lines of sight of other soldiers or turrets.\n  Each soldier also has one bullet. If a soldier has a turret in her horizontal or vertical line\n  of sight, the soldier can shoot and destroy it. Each shot can only destroy one\n  turret, but the soldiers are such excellent shooters that they can even shoot\n  past one or several turrets or soldiers in their line of sight and hit another turret\n  farther away!\nYou are given a map (with the soldier and turret positions marked).

If multiple valid\n  strategies exist, you may output any one of them.\nSoldiers are numbered from 1, reading from left to right along the top row,\n  then left to right along the next row down from the top, and so on, from top\n  to bottom.\nTurrets use their own independent numbers, and are numbered starting from 1,\n  in the same way.\nMemory limit: 1 GB.1 \u2264T\u2264 100.0 \u2264M<C\u00d7R.\nTime limit: 30 seconds.1 \u2264C\u2264 30.1 \u2264R\u2264 30.The number ofSsymbols is between 1 and 10.The number ofTsymbols is between 1 and 10.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.1 \u2264C\u2264 100.1 \u2264R\u2264 100.The number ofSsymbols is between 1 and 100.The number ofTsymbols is between 1 and 100.\nIn Case #2, one of the possible solutions is to move soldier 3 up three\n  cells and shoot turret 3. Then soldier 1 can move up one cell and right one\n  cell (to where turret 3 was) and shoot past turret 2 to destroy turret 1.\n  Finally, soldier 2 can move up three cells and shoot turret 2.\nIn Case #3, soldier 1 can move up one cell, then right three cells and\n  shoot turret 2. Then soldier 2 can move up one cell, then right three cells\n  and shoot turret 1. Finally, soldier 6 can move down one cell, then right\n  three cells and shoot turret 3.

You decide to travel to Planet\n  Care-a-Lot, the most relaxing planet there is. To travel, you are going to\n  use the network of interstellar teleporters.\nA teleporter is a small machine floating around somewhere in space. You can\n  use it remotely from any point in space, but, due to the conservation of\n  teleportation distance principle, it can teleport you to any other point in\n  space at exactly the same L1 distance from the teleporter as your\n  L1 distance to it before the teleportation. The L1 distance between two points\n  at coordinates (x0, y0, z0) and\n  (x1, y1, z1) is given by\n  |x0-  x1| + |y0- y1|\n  + |z0- z1|. Unfortunately, your space jetpack is broken,\n  so you cannot move around on your own; to travel, you can only use the\n  teleporters.\n  You start at Planet Thundera. You can use a teleporter to travel from Planet\n  Thundera to a point p1, then use another to get from p1to p2, and so on. The last teleportation must take you exactly to\n  Planet Care-a-Lot.\nGiven the locations in 3-dimensional space of both planets and all the\n  available teleporters, find out if it is possible for you to make the trip\n  using only teleporters. If the trip can be made, what is the minimum number\n  of teleportations needed to get to your destination? (Even if two\n  teleportations use the same teleporter, they still count as separate\n  teleportations.)\nThe input is given as points with coordinates that are all integers that fall\n  within a certain range. However, you are allowed to teleport to intermediate\n  points with integer or non-integer coordinates, and there are no range\n  restrictions on the points you can visit.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

After each guess that is not correct, we will tell you whether P is\n  higher or lower than your guess.\nThis problem isinteractive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different\n  than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process\n  that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses.\n  All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output.\n  Remember that many programming languages buffer the output by default, so\n  make sure your output actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the\n  buffer) before blocking to wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer.\n  Anything your program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might\n  consume some memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not\n  overflow it. To help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is\n  provided at the very end of the problem statement.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will read a single line with two integersAandB, representing the exclusive lower bound and inclusive\n  upper bound, as described above. In the next line, you will read a single\n  integerN, representing the maximum number of guesses you can make.\n  Your program will process up toNexchanges with our judge.\nFor each exchange, your program needs to use standard output to send a single\n  line with one integer Q: your guess. In response to your guess, the judge\n  will print a single line with one word to your input stream, which your\n  program must read through standard input. The word will beCORRECTif your guess is correct,TOO_SMALLif your\n  guess is less than the correct answer, andTOO_BIGif your guess\n  is greater than the correct answer. Then, you can start another exchange.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g., wrong output format, or\n  out-of-bounds values), the judge will sendWRONG_ANSWERto your input\n  stream and it will not send any other output after that. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after receivingWRONG_ANSWER,\n  your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice\n  that it is your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive\n  the appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\nIf your test case is solved withinNtries, you will receive theCORRECTmessage from the judge, as mentioned above, and then\n  continue to get input (a new line with two integersAandB,\n  etc.) for the next test case. AfterNtries, if the test case is not\n  solved, the judge will printWRONG_ANSWERand then stop sending output\n  to your input stream.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all test\n  cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output after\n  receivingCORRECTfor the last test case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\n1 \u2264T\u2264 20.A= 0.N= 30.Time limit: 10 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.\nB= 30.\nB= 109.\nHere is a piece of pseudocode that demonstrates an interaction for one test set.\n  Suppose there are three test cases in this test set. The pseudocode first reads an\n  integer t, representing the number of test cases. Then the first test case begins.\n  Suppose the correct answer P is 9 for the first test case. The pseudocode first\n  reads three integers a, b, and n, representing the guessing range and maximum\n  number of tries, respectively, and then outputs a guess 30. Since 30 is greater\n  than 9, the stringTOO_BIGis received through stdin from the judge.\n  Then the pseudocode guesses 5 and receivesTOO_SMALLin response.\n  The guess 10 is subsequently printed to stdout which is again too big. Finally\n  the pseudocode guesses 9, and receivesCORRECTbecause 9 is the\n  correct answer.\nThe second test case shows what happens if the code continues to read from stdin\n  after the judge stops sending info. In this example, the contestant guesses 31,\n  which is outside the range (0, 30]. As a result, the judging system sendsWRONG_ANSWERto the input stream of the pseudocode and stops sending anything after that.\n  However, after readingWRONG_ANSWERinto string s, the code continues to read for\n  the next test case. Since there is nothing in the input stream (judge has stopped\n  sending info), the code hangs and will eventually receive a Time Limit Exceeded Error.\nIf the code in the example above exits immediately after readingWRONG_ANSWER,\n  it will receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test\n  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can\n  use ourinteractive runnerfor that.

Then it initializes an array to store the count of senators for each party, where the index corresponds to the ASCII value of the party's corresponding uppercase letter.\nNext, it enters a loop that continues until no party has an absolute majority. In each iteration of this loop, it finds the party with the maximum number of senators and checks if it exceeds half of the total number of senators. If not, it breaks from the loop. Otherwise, it finds the party with the minimum number of senators that is greater than zero and less than or equal to the maximum count. It then selects the pair of parties to evacuate based on these two conditions. Finally, it updates the senator counts for the chosen parties and prints the evacuation plan for the test case. The code repeats this process for each test case until all cases have been processed.",

We want the orchard to look tidy!\nFor example, whenA=11, although the eleven prepared cells in the left\n  figure below form a 3x4 rectangle (that is, with 3 rows and 4 columns), the\n  cell in the center of the rectangle is not prepared. As a result, we have not\n  yet completed preparing our orchard, since not every cell of the 3x4 rectangle\n  is prepared. However, after just preparing the center cell, the rectangle of\n  size at least 11 is fully filled, and the orchard is ready.\nSee below for another example. In this case,A=6. Note that the middle\n  figure prepares a cell outside the 3x2 rectangle, so although the rightmost\n  figure prepares a rectangle of size 6, the entire set of the prepared cells\n  does not form a rectangle (due to the extra cell on the left). As a result,\n  the orchard is not ready.\nDigging is hard work for humans, so we have borrowed theGo gopherfrom theGoogle Goteam and trained it to help us\n  out by preparing cells. We candeploythe gopher by giving it the\n  coordinates of atarget cellin the matrix that is not along any of\n  the borders of the matrix. However, we have not yet perfected the gopher's\n  training, so it will choose a cell uniformly at(pseudo-)randomfrom the 3x3 block of nine cells centered on the target\n  cell, and then prepare the cell it has chosen. (If it chooses a cell that\n  was already prepared, it will uselessly prepare it again.)\nWe can only deploy the gopher up to 1000 times before it gets too tired to\n  keep digging, so we need your help in figuring out how to deploy it\n  strategically. When you deploy the gopher, you will be told which cell the\n  gopher actually prepared, and you can take this information into account\n  before deploying it again, if needed.

See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer.\n  Anything your program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might\n  consume some memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not\n  overflow it. To help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is\n  provided at the very end of the problem statement.

Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will read a single line containing a single\n  integerAindicating the minimum required prepared rectangular area.\n  Then, your program will process up to 1000 exchanges with our judge.\nFor each exchange, your program needs to use standard output to send a single\n  line containing two integers I and J: the row and column number you want to\n  deploy the gopher to. The two integers must be between 2 and 999, and written\n  in base-10 without leading zeroes. If your output format is wrong (e.g., out\n  of bounds values), your program will fail, and the judge will send you a single\n  line with-1 -1which signals that\n  your test has failed, and it will not send anything to your input stream after\n  that. Otherwise, in response to your deployment, the judge will print a single\n  line containing two integers I' and J' to your input stream, which your\n  program must read through standard input.\nIf the last deployment caused the set of prepared cells to be a rectangle\n  of area at leastA, you will get I' = J' = 0, signaling the end of the\n  test case. Otherwise, I' and J' are the row and column numbers of the cell\n  that was actually prepared by the gopher, with abs(I'-I) \u2264 1 and abs(J'-J) \u2264 1.\n  Then, you can start another exchange.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g. wrong output format, or\n  out-of-bounds values), as mentioned above, the judge will send I' = J' = -1,\n  and stop sending output to your input stream afterwards. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after reading in I' = J' = -1, your program\n  will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is\n  your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive the\n  appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\nIf the test case is solved within 1000 deployments, you will receive the\n  I' = J' = 0 message from the judge, as mentioned above, and then continue to\n  solve the next test case. After 1000 exchanges, if the test case is not\n  solved, the judge will send the I' = J' = -1 message, and stop sending output\n  to your input stream after.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all test\n  cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output after\n  receiving I' = J' = 0 message from the judge for the last test case, you will\n  receive a Wrong Answer judgment.\nPlease be advised that for a given test case, the cells that the gopher will pick\n  from each 3x3 block are (pseudo-)random and independent of each other, but\n  they are determined using the same seed each time for the same test case,\n  so a solution that gives an incorrect result for a test case will do so\n  consistently across all attempts for the same test case. We have also set\n  different seeds for different test cases.\n1 \u2264T\u2264 20.Memory limit: 1 GB.\nA= 20.Time limit (for the entire test set): 20 seconds.\nA= 200.Time limit (for the entire test set): 60 seconds.\nThe pseudocode above is the first half of a sample interaction for one test set.\n  Suppose there are only two test cases in this test set. The pseudocode first reads\n  the number of test cases into an integert. Then the first test case begins.\n  For the first test case, supposeAis 3 (although, in the real test sets,Ais always either 20 or 200). The pseudocode first reads the value ofAinto an integera, and outputs10 10the location of\n  the cell to prepare. By (pseudo-)random choice, the cell at location 10 11 is\n  prepared, so the code reads10 11in response. Next, the code\n  outputs cell10 10again for preparation, and the gopher prepares10 10this time. The code subsequently sends10 12with\n  the goal of finishing preparing a rectangle of size 3, but only gets cell10 11prepared again.10 10is then sent out, and this time11 10is prepared. Notice that although the prepared area is of size 3,\n  a rectangle has not been formed, so the preparation goes on. In the end, the pseudocode\n  decides to try out cell11 10, and0 0is sent back, which\n  implies that cell 11 11 has been prepared, completing a rectangle (or square, rather)\n  or size 4. As a result, the first test case is successfully solved.\nNow the pseudocode is ready for the second test case. It again first reads an integera = 3and decides to send cell10 10to prepare.\n  However, this time, the code forgets to\n    flush the stdout buffer! As a result, 10 10 is buffered and not sent to the judge.\n  Both the judge and the code wait on each other, leading to a deadlock and eventually a\n  Time Limit Exceeded error.\nThe code above is another example. Suppose for the second test case, the code\n  remembers to flush the output buffer, but sends out cell1 1to prepare.\n  Remember that the row and column of the chosen cell must both be in the range\n  [2, 999], so 1 1 is illegal! As a result, the judge sends back-1 -1.\n  However, after reading-1 -1into x and y, the code proceeds to\n  send another cell location to the judge, and wait. Since there is nothing in\n  the input stream (the judge has stopped sending info), the code hangs and will\n  eventually receive a Time Limit Exceeded error.\nNote that if the code in the example above exits immediately after reading-1 -1, it will receive a Wrong Answer instead:\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

The only way the President can hack\n  (without the robot noticing) is by swapping two adjacent instructions. For\n  example, the President could hack the above program once by swapping the\n  third and fourth instructions to make itSCSCSC. This would\n  reduce the total damage to 7.

We have taken a careful\n  look at the classicbubble sortalgorithm, and we are pleased to announce a new variant.\nThe basic operation of the standard bubble sort algorithm is to examine a\n  pair of adjacent numbers, and reverse that pair if the left number is\n  larger than the right number. But our algorithm examines a group ofthreeadjacent numbers, and if the leftmost number is larger than the\n  rightmost number, it reverses that entire group. Because our algorithm is a\n  \"triplet bubble sort\", we have named it Trouble Sort for short.\nFor example, for L = 5 6 6 4 3, Trouble Sort would proceed as follows:\nWe were looking forward to presenting Trouble Sort at the Special Interest\n  Group in Sorting conference in Hawaii, but one of our interns has just\n  pointed out a problem: it is possible that Trouble Sort does not correctly\n  sort the list! Consider the list 8 9 7, for example.\nWe need your help with some further research. Given a list ofNintegers, determine whether Trouble Sort will successfully sort the list into\n  non-decreasing order.

In addition,\n  keep in mind that certain languages have a small input buffer size by default.\nSample Case #1 is similar to the first one described in the problem\n  statement. Trouble Sort correctly sorts this list, so the answer isOK.\nSample Case #2 is the second one described in the problem statement.

        "prompt_text": "You own a lollipop shop. At the start of the day, you makeNlollipops, each of a single unique flavor, like huckleberry, cherry or lime.Ncustomers come into the shop during the day, one at a time. Each\n  customer gives you a list of which of your lollipop flavors they like. You\n  can sell them one lollipop of any of those flavors, as long as you have not\n  already sold someone else the same flavor earlier in the day (since there is\n  only one lollipop of each flavor). If none of the flavors they like are still\n  available, you cannot sell them a lollipop, and they leave your shop\n  disappointed.\nYou do not know what each customer's flavor preferences are going to be until\n  they arrive. Each customer decides if they like or dislike each flavor\n  randomly, independently of whether they like any other flavor, or what\n  flavors anyone else likes. However, your market studies have shown that some\n  flavors may have a higher probability of being liked in general! For example,\n  the lime flavor might have a 10% chance of being liked by any particular\n  customer, whereas that chance might be 1% for the cherry flavor. These values\n  are always chosen independently and uniformly at random from the interval\n  [0.005, 0.1].\nObviously, you want to sell lollipops to as many of theNcustomers\n  as possible! But, since you do not know what flavors your customers will ask\n  for ahead of time, you cannot always make an optimal decision \u2014\n  sometimes you might sell a customer one flavor, and then later wish you had\n  sold them another.\nSuppose that you somehow knew all the customers' preferences in advance and\n  could plan ahead; then there is some maximum number M of lollipops that you\n  could possibly sell. You do not know the customers' preferences in advance,\n  but we require you to sell a number of lollipops that is at least 90% of M\n  foreachinput case.\nThis problem isinteractive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different\n  than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process\n  that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses.\n  All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output.\n  Remember that many programming languages buffer the output by default, so\n  make sure your output actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the\n  buffer) before blocking to wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer.\n  Anything your program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might\n  consume some memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not\n  overflow it.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program should read a single line with one integerN, the number of lollipops (which is the same as the number of\n  customers).\nThen, for each of the customers, your program should read a single line,\n  which will contain space-separated integers. The first integer isD,\n  the number of flavors that customer likes. Then,Dintegers follow,\n  the ID numbers of those flavors, in strictly increasing order. Flavors have\n  unique ID numbers in the range [0,N- 1]. Note thatDmight be\n  zero for some or all customers.\nAfter each of these lines, your program must write a single line to standard\n  output, containing the ID number of one of theDflavors to sell to the\n  customer, or-1if no lollipop is to be sold to the customer.\n  After you have written theNth line for the test case,\n  your program should terminate if it was the last test case; otherwise, it\n  should start reading data for the next test case.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g., tries to sell a customer a flavor\n  that was already sold, or tries to sell a customer a flavor they don't like,\n  or uses the wrong output format, or outputs an out-of-bounds value), the\n  judge will send-1to your input\n  stream and it will not send any other output after that. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after receiving-1,\n  your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice\n  that it is your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive\n  the appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\n  Not selling enough lollipops for a test case will not cause you to get the-1message.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after processing all\n  test cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output\n  after the last test case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\nAt the start of each test case, the judge will determine all customers'\n  preferences. That is, it will use a (hidden) list of probabilities\n  Pibetween 0.005 and 0.1, one for each flavor; each customer has\n  a probability Piof liking the i-th flavor. That is, the random\n  variables indicating whether customer j likes flavor i are independent and\n  identically distributed. These preferences are constant throughout the test\n  and will not be modified e.g. in response to your choices.\nT= 50.N= 200.0 \u2264D\u2264N.Time limit (for the entire test set): 25 seconds.Memory limit: 1GB.\nNote that this sample interaction has smaller values ofTandNthan the real data.  The local testing tool also uses smaller cases.\nThe pseudocode above demonstrates the following scenario.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test\n  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can\n  use ourinteractive runnerfor that. For more information, read the instructions in comments in that\n  file, and also check out theInteractive Problems sectionof the FAQ.\nInstructions for the testing tool are included in comments within the tool.\n  We encourage you to add your own test cases. Please be advised that although\n  the testing tool is intended to simulate the judging system, it isNOTthe real judging system and might behave differently.

Construction is\n  done using a special fence-shooting 3D printer. There is only one such\n  device, so fences are built one at a time. The printer is small enough that\n  you can consider it a single point on the plane.\nTo build a fence f, you must first position the printer at a point p in the\n  plane such that the printer can see all of f without being obstructed by\n  previously constructed fences.

You can choose any position for the printer to be at before the\n  first fence is built and after the last fence is built.\nHaving to follow this procedure means that you cannot necessarily build the\n  fences in any order. For example, you might choose an order that blocks off\n  the printer and prevents you from moving it to where it needs to be.\nThe director of the organization has drafted a relative ordering involvingKof the fences (but none of these have been built yet) without giving\n  much thought to it.\n  To avoid angering them, you need to use this ordering, inserting\n  the remainingF-Kfences anywhere you like to complete the\n  ordering.\nGiven these restrictions, find an order in which to build the fences.

The fences are sorted based on whether they were provided in the director's ordering or not.

This function also checks that each fence appears only once in the ordering.\n\nThe `solve` function iterates through all possible orderings of the fences using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module and filters out invalid orderings using the `is_valid` function. If there are no valid orderings, it prints \"No solution\" for that test case. Otherwise, it prints the first valid ordering found.",

        "prompt_text": "A research consortium is building a new datacenter. In the datacenter,\n  a set of computers is set up to work together and communicate via a network.\n  The network works only with direct bidirectional links between computers.\n  A pair of computers c1and c2that are not connected\n  by a direct link can still communicate with each other, as long as there is\n  at least one path of links l1, l2, ..., lksuch that links liand li+1share an endpoint,\n  c1is an endpoint of l1, and c2is an\n  endpoint of lk. Any two computers can have at most one direct link between\n  them.\nThe consortium has asked you to submit a design that illustrates how many\n  computers will be in the network and how they will be connected to each other.\n  Each network design you submit must comply with a specific set of\n  restrictions:\nTo elaborate on the last point: each of the N computers in a network design\n  is initially assigned a unique integer between 1 and N that identifies it.\n  However, it is possible that after some downtime, the system will boot up\n  and the indentifiers will be permuted \u2014 that is, each computer will\n  still have a unique integer between 1 and N, but not necessarily the original\n  one. The network must be able to recover the original identifying integers\n  without having access to any information other than the existing direct links.\nTo evaluate your network designs, the research consortium has set up an\n  automated program. The program will receive one of your network designs,\n  validate conditions 1-3 above, and then send back a copy of the network\n  design with the following changes:\nYou need to be able to determine exactly how the IDs were changed. Formally,\n  the automated program will create a secret random permutation f of the\n  integers 1 through N, and it will assign those numbers to computers in a\n  \"blank copy\" of the network with all of the previous links removed. Then, for\n  each link between computers i and j in your network design, it will add a\n  link between f(i) and f(j) to the copy. You then must recreateexactlythe f that the automated program created. If there exists a different f' that\n  yields the same result and you return f', the consortium will not accept your\n  network design, as in such a case, you cannot ensure that the recovered IDs\n  are the original ones.\nFor every N between 10 and 100, inclusive, there exists at least one network\n  of N computers that complies with all restrictions above and has the property\n  that applying two different permutations f and f' to it produces two\n  different sets of links.\nThis problem isinteractive,\n  which means that the concepts of input and output are different than in\n  standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process that\n  both provides you with information and evaluates your responses. All\n  information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output. Remember that many\n  programming languages buffer the output by default, so make sure your output\n  actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the buffer) before blocking to\n  wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer. Anything your\n  program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might consume some\n  memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not overflow it. To\n  help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is provided at the\n  very end of the problem statement. In addition, sample solutions to a\n  previous Code Jam interactive problem (in all of our supported languages) are\n  provided in the analysis forNumber Guessing.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will first read a single line containing two\n  integersLandUindicating the inclusive range of values for\n  the number of computers in your network design.\nThen, you need to create a network design with N computers and print 2N+1\n  lines representing that design. The first line must contain a single integer\n  N. The remaining 2N lines must contain two integers A and B each, each\n  representing a different link between computers A and B, where A != B. Notice\n  that if you list link A B, you may not list A B nor B A again.\nUpon reading your network design, the judge will first check the first three\n  conditions listed in the statement above. If any of those is not met, the\n  judge will send you a single line containing a single-1, and\n  then finish all communication and wait for your program to finish. If your\n  program does finish correctly and without violating other limits, it\n  will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\nIf all of the conditions are met, the judge will send you 2N+1 lines. The\n  first line will contain a single integer N (the same N you sent). Then, the\n  next 2N lines will contain two integers each, describing the links of the\n  copy of the network design, in the same format as you used. The copy is\n  generated as described above, with the permutation f chosen uniformly at\n  random from all possible permutations, independently of your network design.\nTo finish a test case, you need to send the judge a single line with N\n  integers X1, X2, ..., XN, representing that\n  the computer to which you assigned number i was assigned number Xiin the judge's copy, for all i.\nIf the list is not the list the judge generated, you will receive a Wrong\n  Answer verdict. If it was in the last test case, the judge will send no\n  additional communication. Otherwise, the judge will send a single line\n  containing a single -1, and then no additional communication. In both cases,\n  the judge will wait for your program to end, and assign the Wrong Answer\n  verdict only if it ended normally and without violating any resource limits.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all\n  test cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output\n  after printing the list of Xs for the last test case, you will receive a\n  Wrong Answer judgment.\nNotice that you are allowed to submit the same network design for different\n  test cases, as long as that design complies with all restrictions for both\n  cases. Additionally, the seed from random generation in the judge is fixed,\n  so sending the same set of original network designs in the same order will\n  get back the same set of copies.\n1 \u2264T\u2264 30.Time limit: 10 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.\nL= 10.U= 50.\n10 \u2264L\u2264 50.L=U.\nNote that this sample interaction uses a smaller value ofLthan the\n  real data, for ease of illustration. Also note that there is no network of\n  exactly 6 computers with the property that applying two different\n  permutations f and f' to it produces two different sets of links, so it would\n  be a bad idea to design a network of exactly 6 computers, even if the\n  problem's limits allowed it!\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

In fact, they kept hosting larger and larger parties over the\n  years, so they needed to raise the roof of their ballroom to keep the noise\n  level tolerable.\nWe know that the roof of their ballroom was always supported by the tips of\n  exactly three columns; these columns were infinitely thin line segments that\n  originated on the floor and rose up perpendicular to the floor. Whenever the\n  society wanted to raise the roof, they would begin by removing the existing\n  roof. Then, they would build a new column in a location where there was not\n  already a column. Finally, they would rest a new roof on the tips of the new\n  column and the two most recently built of the previously existing columns.\n  For mystical reasons, no three column bases were ever collinear, and no four\n  column tips were ever coplanar.\nEach roof was a convex polygon that was part of the plane defined by the three tips that\n  supported it. For each column c built before the supporting ones, the\n  roof did not intersect c at any point and was large enough to cover the\n  space above c. The roof did not touch the floor. The different roofs did not necessarily\n  all have the same shape.\nOn an archeological dig, you found allNcolumns that the society ever\n  built, but no roof. You want to determine a possible order in which the\n  columns could have been built that is consistent with the rules above. A\n  possible order is an ordering of theNcolumns such that, for each\n  prefix of length at least 4 of the ordering, there is a roof (convex polygon)\n  that contains the tips of the last three columns in the prefix, and for each other\n  column in the prefix with a tip at (x, y, h) the roof contains a point (x, y, z)\n  with z > h.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

It runs from (0, 0) to\n  (0, 1000) in a 2D plane in a confidential and very flat location.\nNaturally, this segment is extremely valuable, so it is protected byNrotating surveillance lasers, which are rays in the 2D plane. Each laser\n  has a fixed endpoint, and it rotates around that endpoint at a constant speed\n  of 1 revolution per second. Whether each laser rotates clockwise or\n  counterclockwise is chosen uniformly and independently at random by the\n  security system.\nLasers are not blocked by other lasers or their endpoints, or the segment\n  itself. No laser has an endpoint on the segment.\nYou have been hired to audit the security system, but all you have to work\n  with is a single snapshot from an instant in time, which shows the endpoint\n  and orientation (at that instant) of each laser. Since the image is just a\n  snapshot, you have no way of inferring the rotation directions of the lasers.\nYou have determined that the segment could be stolen in a heist if there is\n  ever a non-empty open interval of time during which no laser is touching the\n  segment.

(Also note that the second and third lasers\n  have the same initial orientation even though it is specified differently.)\n  Regardless of their rotation directions, though, each of these lasers only\n  touches the segment at the instant that it is pointing in the negative y\n  direction, so there is clearly some other open interval during which no laser\n  is touching the segment, and the answer is 1.\nIn Sample Case #2, each of the lasers touches the segment during exactly 1/4\n  of its rotation, and the segment will be touched by a laser at all times if\n  and only if lasers 1 and 4 rotate in the same direction, and lasers 2 and 3\n  rotate in the same direction. The probability of that is 1/4, so the answer is 3/4.\nSample Case #3 is like Sample Case #2, but with a slight difference that\n  guarantees that there will be an instant at which no laser is touching the\n  segment, even if the lasers are all rotating the same way.

They are even more popular than the Teenage Permutant\n  Ninja Turtles!\nSome critics of the show claim that the team only has its arrangment gimmick\n  so that the owners of the show can sell 120 separate sets of 5 action figures,\n  each of which features the team in a different left-to-right order, glued to\n  a base so that the set cannot be rearranged.

Paper\n  beats Rock and loses to Scissors; Rock beats Scissors and loses to Paper;\n  Scissors beats Paper and loses to Rock.\nWhen two robots face off in a match, the first robot to play a winning\n  move wins.

If the moves are the same, each robot plays the next\n  move in its program, and so on.\nWhenever a robot has reached the end of its program and needs its next move,\n  it returns to the start of its program. So, for example, the fifth move of a\n  robot with the programRSSPwould beR.

The molecular\nweight of a molecule is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms it contains.\nAs a first step towards figuring out exact molecular weights for the molecules and atomic weights\nfor the two elements, Muriel wants to sort the molecules by strictly increasing molecular weight.\nTo assess the difficulty of that task, she wants to know how many orders are valid\nconsidering only the information she has right now. An ordering of the molecules is considered\nvalid if there exist values for the atomic weights of Codium and Jamarium such that the ordering isstrictlyincreasing in molecular weight.\nTo give an example, we represent each molecule by the ordered pair of the number of\natoms of Codium and Jamarium it contains. If Muriel has 3 molecules represented\nby (1, 1), (2, 1) and (1, 2), there are two possible orderings that can be strictly increasing in\nmolecular weight:\n(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2). The first ordering is valid for any\nassignment of atomic weights in which Codium is the heaviest of the two elements, and\nthe second is valid for any assignment in which Jamarium is the heaviest.

The problems can otherwise be solved independently; you do not need to read\nor solve one in order to read or solve the other.\nMuriel is on the path to discovering two new elements that she has named Codium and Jamarium.\nShe has not been able to isolate them yet, but she wants to start investigating some\nimportant properties, like their atomic weights, by indirect means.\nSince Muriel is working with a single isotope of Codium and a single isotope of Jamarium,\ntheir atomic weights are strictly positive integers.\nMuriel managed to createNdifferent molecules, each of which contains one or\nmore atoms of Codium and one or more atoms of Jamarium, and no other elements.\nFor each molecule, she knows how many atoms of each element are present in it. The molecular\nweight of a molecule is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms it contains.\nAs a first step, Muriel sorted the molecules by strictly increasing molecular weight. Now she\nwants to find out possible integer values for the atomic weights of both Codium and Jamarium that\nare consistent with the ordering. Since she is aware there could be many consistent pairs of\nvalues, she wants one that minimizes the atomic weight of Codium. If there are multiple\npairs in which Codium's atomic weight is minimum, she wants the one in which Jamarium's\natomic weight is minimum.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\nThe first line of a test case contains a single integerN, the number of molecules. Each\nof the nextNlines describes a different molecule with two integersCiandJithat represent the number of Codium and Jamarium atoms in the i-th\nmolecule, respectively.

Given that the one having the extra Codium is heavier\n  overall, we conclude that Codium must be heavier than Jamarium. The values 2 and 1 for\n  the atomic weights of Codium and Jamarium make the molecular weights\n  1 \u00d7 2 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 3, 1 \u00d7 2 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 4, and\n  2 \u00d7 2 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 5, respecting the strict ordering. Since Codium is heavier\n  than Jamarium in this case, 2 is Codium's minimum atomic weight, and 1 is of course\n  Jamarium's minimum atomic weight.\nLet a, b, c and d be the molecular weights of the molecules in Sample Case #2,\n  in increasing order of molecular weight. By their atom contents, d = 2 \u00d7 a\n  and c = 2 \u00d7 b. It follows from a < b that d = 2 \u00d7 a < 2 \u00d7 b = c,\n  which means there is no pair of values for the atomic weights that would make the ordering\n  strictly increasing.\nIn Sample Case #3, notice that the molecules happen to be sorted in strictly increasing order of\n  total number of atoms. Therefore, assigning both elements an atomic weight of 1 makes the atomic\n  weights be sorted in strictly increasing order.\n",

The company will always assign you the\n  number 100 \u2014 that is, you replace player 100.\nYou have found some ways to tamper with the lottery at night, but security\n  is tight, so you can only do so much! Specifically, after each of the first\n  99 days of the lottery, you may do exactlyoneof the following:\nYou may perform different actions on different nights, and you may choose\n  dynamically: you do not need to decide on all of your actions in advance.\nOn the 100th day, it is your turn to insert your token into a vase of your\n  choice (you do not need to choose uniformly at random). You cannot perform\n  any other actions on that day.\nYou know that if there is a winning vase with more than one token for the same player,\n  it will be obvious that cheating has occurred and nobody will win. However, it does not\n  matter if other vases contain more than one token for the same player because the\n  organizers never see those tokens.\nYour goal is to be a winner in at least 90% of the test cases.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in theInteractive Problems sectionof our FAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nAt the start of a test case, the judge outputs one line with one integer:\n  the number of the current day. (The judge starts on day 1, and on the\n  i-th day, it prints i.) After your program reads the integer, it should write\n  a line containing two integers V and P, with 1 \u2264 V \u2264 20, and\n  0 \u2264 P \u2264 100. The judge will interpret these as follows:\nNotice that on turn 100, you must put your own token in, so P must be 100.\nRemember that on the i-th day, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 99, the judge\n  simulates the action of the i-th player, as described in the statement. This\n  happens before your own action on that day.\nAfter you send your move for turn 100, your program should terminate if it\n  was the last test case; otherwise, it should start reading data for the next\n  test case. (Notice that the judge does not tell you whether you got each case\n  correct or incorrect.) The judge will only check whether you have enough\n  correct answers after you have attempted allTtest cases, so you\n  should not stop early! For example, if you answer the first 225 out of 250\n  cases correctly and then exit, or provide malformed input, your solution will\n  not be considered correct.\nIf your program outputs something illegal (e.g., gives an invalid value for P\n  or V, or tries to inspect a vase on turn 100), the judge will send\n  one line containing-1to your input stream, and it will not\n  send any other output after that. If your program continues to wait for the\n  judge after receiving-1, your program will time out, resulting\n  in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have\n  your program exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a\n  Time Limit Exceeded error.

However, she is worried that there might be too many stacks,\n  so she intends to remove the L leftmost stacks and the R rightmost stacks,\n  where L and R are nonnegative integers such that L + R \u2264S- 3.\n  (Notice that at least 3 stacks of pancakes will remain after the removal.)\nYour supervisor also thinks the remaining stacks will look aesthetically\n  pleasing if they have thepyramid property.

Thepyramidification costof a sequence of stacks is the\n  minimum total number of pancakes that must be added to stacks to give the\n  sequence the pyramid property.\nWhile your manager is carefully deciding which values of L and R to choose,\n  you have started to wonder what the sum of the pyramidification costs over\n  all valid choices of L and R is. Compute this sum, modulo the prime\n  109+7 (1000000007).\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

The optimal strategy for that\n  scenario is to add a single pancake to the middle stack. Although the\n  resulting sequence of stacks looks flat, notice that it has the pyramid\n  property; in fact, any index will work as the j value.In Sample Case #2, here are all possible choices of L and R, the\n  corresponding remaining stacks, and what you should do in each scenario.L = 0, R = 0: H = [1 6 2 5 7]. The optimal solution is to add\n    four pancakes to the third stack and one pancake to the fourth stack. Then\n    we have [1 6 6 6 7], which has the pyramid property with j = 5.L = 0, R = 1: H = [1 6 2 5]. The optimal solution is to add\n    three pancakes to the third stack. Then we have [1 6 5 5], which has the\n    pyramid property with j = 2.L = 0, R = 2: H = [1 6 2]. This already has the pyramid property\n    with j = 2.L = 1, R = 0: H = [6 2 5 7]. The optimal solution is to add\n    four pancakes to the second stack and one pancake to the third stack. Then\n    we have [6 6 6 7], which has the pyramid property with j = 4.L = 1, R = 1: H = [6 2 5]. The optimal solution is to add three\n    pancakes to the second stack. Then we have [6 5 5], which has the pyramid\n    property with j = 1.L = 2, R = 0: H = [2 5 7]. This already has the pyramid property\n    with j = 3.So the answer is (5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 0) modulo (109+ 7), which\n  is 16.In Sample Case #3, we only need to add extra pancakes to create the pyramid\n  property when L = 0 and R = 0.

Both\n  N and the kings' coordinates are unknown to you. However, you do know the\n  following things:\nThe kings want to meet in a single cell of the board. If some cell (X, Y)\n  were to be chosen as the meeting cell, then in order to get there, the i-th\n  king would use a number of moves equal to the maximum of the absolute values\n  of the differences of coordinates between its cell and the meeting cell:\n  max(|X-Xi|,|Y-Yi|). The total number of moves used by\n  all kings is thus equal to the sum of those maximums over all values of i.\n  Note that it is not relevant to this problem exactly how the kings move on\n  the board \u2014 only the source and destination cells matter, and the\n  number of moves can always be computed using the above formula.\nThis problem has two phases. In the first phase, you may repeatedly do the\n  following: propose a meeting location (A, B) (with each of A and B between\n  -10\u00d7Mand 10\u00d7M, inclusive), and have the judge tell\n  you the total number of moves the kings would use to get there \u2014 the\n  sum (over all i) of max(|Xi-A|,|Yi-B|). You can have at\n  mostRsuch exchanges with the judge, choosing your values of A and\n  B each time. Note that the kings do not actually move, so their locations\n  (Xi, Yi) stay the same for all requests within one test\n  case.\nIn the second phase, the roles are swapped: the judge gives you a meeting\n  cell location (C, D) (with each of C and D between -10\u00d7Mand\n  10\u00d7M, inclusive), and you must respond with the total number of\n  moves the kings would use to get there, assuming that the kings are in the\n  same locations as in the first phase. There are at mostRsuch\n  exchanges, and you must correctly respond to all of the judge's requests.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing four integersT,Nmax,MandR: the number of test\n  cases, the maximum number of kings, the maximum absolute value for any\n  coordinate for any king, and the maximum number of requests per phase,\n  respectively. (Note that the values ofMandRare fixed,\n  and are provided as input only for convenience; see the Limits section for\n  more details.) Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nIn each test case, there are two phases. In the first phase, the i-th exchange\n  is as follows:\nYou may initiate at mostRsuch exchanges in this phase. If you make\n  more thanRexchanges, or send a request that the judge can not parse\n  or is out of bounds, the judge responds with one line with a single stringERROR.\nTo end the first phase and switch to the second phase, you must send one line\n  with the stringREADY(the case does not matter), to which the\n  judge responds with the first request of the second phase.\nIn the second phase, the i-th exchange is as follows:\nThe judge is guaranteed to send at least 1 and at mostRsuch\n  requests. If you send an answer that is incorrect or unparseable, the judge\n  responds withERRORas described above. If you answer all of the\n  requests correctly, the judge sends one line with a single stringDONE, at which point your program should initiate the next\n  test case, or terminate with no error if allTtest cases have been\n  handled.\nAfter the judge sends a line withERROR, it does not send any\n  other output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after receivingERROR, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program\n  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\nThe number and location of the kings, as well as the number and positions of\n  the requests that the judge sends during the second phases, are chosen before\n  any exchanges occur.\nTime limit: 60 seconds per test set.Note that a program that just makes valid exchanges with the judge (and\n    does no other processing) takes the following time in our environment:\n    ~13 seconds for C++, ~24 seconds for Java, ~19 seconds\n    for Python and Go.Memory limit: 1GB.1 \u2264T\u2264 15.M= 106.-M\u2264 Xi\u2264M, for all i.-M\u2264 Yi\u2264M, for all i.The pairs (Xi, Yi) are distinct.-10\u00d7M\u2264Ci\u2264 10\u00d7M,\n    for all i.-10\u00d7M\u2264Di\u2264 10\u00d7M,\n    for all i.R= 1000.\nNmax= 1.\nNmax= 10.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

Cynthia knows exactly where\nMarlin needs to go, and she can be very precise in giving directions. While Marlin is smart and\ncan follow them perfectly, keeping track of a long list of directions can be problematic.\nCynthia needs to find a way to make the list of directions short.\nMarlin lives in a matrix ofRrows andCcolumns. Some cells of the\nmatrix are dangerous and cannot be entered. Marlin and his son are currently in\ndifferent non-dangerous cells. Marlin's son never moves to a different cell.\nCynthia decided to give Marlin directions in the form of a program consisting\nof a list of instructions, each on a single line. Each instruction is of one of\n5 types:\nAfter executing a line with any of the first 4 instructions, Marlin jumps to the next\nline on the list if there is one. If there is no next line,\nMarlin just stands still forever.\nFor example, if Marlin were following the program\nhe would move North (line 1), then East (2),\nthen jump to line 6 without physically moving (3), then move West (6),\nthen jump to line 4 (7), then move South (4), then jump to line 1 (5),\nthen move North (1), etc.\nIf at any point Marlin and his son are at the same cell, they will be reunited\nand Marlin will no longer follow any instructions. Cynthia the turtle wants to find out the\nsmallest number of lines in a program that would get Marlin to the same cell as his\nson, without him ever going into a dangerous cell or moving outside of the matrix\nboundaries. AllGinstructions must jump to existing lines in the program.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\nEach test case starts with a line containingRandC, the number of\nrows and columns in the matrix.

For each test case, it initializes a grid with the given dimensions and fills it with input characters. It finds the starting position (Marlin) and the end position (Marlin's son). If there is no end position, it prints \"IMPOSSIBLE\" for that test case and moves on to the next one.\n\nIf an end position is found, it uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from Marlin to his son. The BFS function takes a grid, start position, and end position as input. It initializes visited set and queue with the start position, then iterates over the BFS directions (North, East, South, West). For each direction, it checks if the next position is within the matrix boundaries and not dangerous, and if so, adds it to the queue and marked as visited. If the end position is found during the BFS search, it returns the number of visited nodes. Otherwise, it returns -1.\n\nFinally, the code prints the result for each test case in the format \"Case #x: y\", where x is the test case number and y is either \"IMPOSSIBLE\" or the smallest number of instructions to get Marlin to his son.",

Can you find\n  the entire array, such that your answer is accurateas of the time that you give it? Answering does not count as a query,\n  so if you answer after your 30th query, for example, the array will be the\n  same as it was after your 21st through 30th queries.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in theInteractive Problems sectionof our FAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing two integersTandB: the number of test cases and the number of bits\n  in the array, respectively. Note thatBis the same for every test\n  case.\nThen, you need to processTtest cases. In each case, the judge begins\n  with a predeterminedB-bit array; note that this array can vary from\n  test case to test case, and is not necessarily chosen at random. Then, you\n  may make up to 150 queries of the following form:\nThen, after you have made as many of the 150 queries above as you want, you\n  must make one more exchange of the following form:\nAfter the judge sendsNto your input stream, it will not send\n  any other output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receivingN, your program will time out, resulting in a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your\n  program exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error.

The dartboard is circular and its radius is\n  betweenAandBnanometers, inclusive.\n  The dartboard is fully contained within the wall, but it may touch its edges.\n  The center of the dartboard is an integer number of nanometers from each edge of the wall.\nGary invited his friend Mika over to play an interesting game. Gary blindfolds Mika and\n  challenges her to throw a dart at the center of the dartboard. To help her, whenever Mika\n  throws a dart at the wall, Gary will tell her whether the dart hit the dartboard.\nMika does not know where on the wall the dartboard is, but since Mika is very skilled at darts,\n  she can throw darts with nanometer precision. That is, she can aim and hit exactly any point that\n  is an integer number of nanometers away from each edge of the wall. Immediately after throwing\n  each dart, Gary tells her whether she hit the center of the dartboard, some other part of it, or\n  missed it completely and hit the bare wall.\nCan you help Mika hit the center of the dartboard, without throwing more than 300 darts?\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing three integersT,AandB, indicating the number of test cases and the inclusive minimum and maximum\n  values for the dartboard's radius, in nanometers, respectively.

For each test case you need to process up to 300 exchanges\n  with the judge.

We will denote a card with rank r and suit s as\n  (r, s).\nBeing brand new, the deck is sorted from top to bottom by suit in increasing\n  order, with ties being broken by ranks in increasing order.

Each server has a random subset of 10 distinct uppercase English\nletters to use as digits, and a random mapping from those letters to unique values between\n0 and 9.\nThe formal description of the current situation is as follows: each server has adigit stringD composed of exactly 10 different uppercase English letters.\nThe digit string defines the mapping between letters and the base 10 digits:\nD's j-th character from the left (counting from 0) is the base 10 digit of value j.\nFor example, if D wereCODEJAMFUNthenCwould represent\ndigit 0,Owould represent digit 1 andNwould represent\ndigit 9. The number 379009 would be encoded asEFNCCNwhen using that\ndigit string.\nWhen receiving the i-th query with an integer parameter Mi, the server:chooses an integer Niat random from\n    the inclusive range 1 through Mi,writes it as a base 10 string with no leading zeroes using the\nj-th character of D (counting starting from 0) as the digit of value j, andreturns the resulting string as the responseRi.\nWe collected some data that we believe we can use to recover the secret digit string D\nfrom each server. We sent 104queries to each server. For each query, we chose a\nvalue Miat random from the range 1 through 10U- 1,\ninclusive, and received the responseRi, a string of up toUuppercase English letters.\nWe recorded the pairs (Mi,Ri).\nAs we were moving these records to a new data storage device, the\nvalues of all the integers Miwithin the records of some servers became\ncorrupted and unreadable.\nCan you help us find each server's digit string D?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

(i represents the current position of the cursor, counting starting\n  from 1 for the leftmost position.)\nWe think Emacs++ will be simple for power users, but we still need to\n  understand how efficient it is. We have a single Lisp++ program and list ofQqueries about that program; each query consists of a start positionSjand an end positionEj. To answer the j-th query,\n  you must determine the smallest possible amount of time Nj(in\n  seconds) that it will take to take the cursor from positionSjto positionEj, if you make optimal decisions.\nPlease output the sum of all of those Njvalues.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

Notice that\n  without the wormhole, the ball would just stay in the first hole it touches,\n  so it would be impossible to touch more than one hole.\n\nIn Sample Case #2, we can connect the holes at (0, 0) and at (5, 5). We can\n  then hit the ball from position (4.9, 5), for example, in the positive horizontal direction\n  so that it first touches the hole at (5, 5). It goes into that hole and comes out of the\n  hole at (0, 0), retaining its positive horizontal direction of movement. Finally, it\n  touches the hole at (5, 0), and stops (since there is no wormhole linked to that hole).\n\nIn Sample Case #3, we can connect the pair of holes at positions (0, 0) and\n  (5, 0), and also the pair of holes at positions (3, 2) and (5, 5). Hitting\n  the ball from (4, -1) towards the hole at (5, 0) makes it touch the holes at\n  positions (5, 0), (0, 0), (5, 5) and (3, 2), in that order.\n\nIn Sample Case #4, we can connect the pairs of holes at positions (0, 0) and\n  (1, 1), the pair of holes at positions (2, 1) and (11, 2), and also the pair of holes\n  at positions (8, 2) and (14, 2). Hitting\n  the ball from (-1, 0) towards the hole at (0, 0) makes it touch the holes at the following\n  positions, in this order: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (11, 2), (14, 2), (8, 2), (11, 2), (2, 1),\n  and (3, 1). Note that although the holes at positions\n  (11, 2) and (2, 1) are touched twice, they are only counted once each for the answer,\n  since the problem asks for a count of distinct holes.\n\nIn Sample Case #5, there is only one hole, and we can hit the ball into it\n  without needing to consider wormholes at all. (For what it's worth, we can\n  choose any starting location we want, even outside of the allowable range of\n  coordinates for holes.)\n\n",

Cameron wants to name the baby one name\n  (the stringC), whereas Jamie wants to name the baby something else\n  (the stringJ).\nYou want to help them find acompromise namethat is as close as possible\n  to what each of them wants. You think you can do this using the notion ofedit distance. The edit distance between two strings S1and\n  S2is the minimum number of operations required to transform\n  S1into S2, where the allowed operations are as follows:\nFor example, the edit distance betweenCAMERONandJAMIEis 5. One way to accomplish the transformation in 5 steps\n  is the following:CAMERONtoJAMERON(change) toJAMIERON(insert) toJAMIEON(delete) toJAMIEN(delete) toJAMIE(delete).\n  Any transformation fromCAMERONintoJAMIErequires at least this many operations.\nTo make the compromise name N as close as possible to the original desires\n  of the parents, you want N to be a non-empty string\n  such that the sum of the edit distances betweenCand N and\n  betweenJand N is as small as possible.\n  Out of all those choices for N, to make sure the compromise is fair,\n  you must choose an N such that the\n  difference between those two edit distances is also as small as possible.\n  Please find a compromise name for Cameron and Jamie.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each case consists of a single line with two\n  stringsCandJ: the names that Cameron and Jamie have\n  proposed for the baby, respectively.

However the sum of those distances would be 6, which is not\n  minimal, so it would not be an acceptable answer.\nXZZYis also unacceptable. Its edit distances toCandJ,\n  respectively, are 1 and 3.

The company is about to take its first drone \"Principia\" to market.\nYou are tasked with designing backup systems for Principia, in case it\nloses access to its primary geolocation systems (like GPS), but it still needs a way to get\ndirections. Principia is designed for use on a flat region; formally, the region is a Cartesian\nplane in which the coordinates are in meters. One or more points on this plane aredrone repair centers. No two drone repair centers are at the same location.\nPrincipia has a system that can retrieve the relative locations of drone repair centers\nthat are within an L1distance (which is also known asManhattan distance)\nof at mostDmeters of its location. The information retrieved is a set of repair center\nlocations relative to Principia's current location. For example: \"there is a repair center 4 meters\nnorth and 3.5 meters west, and another one 2.5 meters east\". Notice that the information does\nnot identify repair centers; it gives their locations relative to Principia.\nYou quickly realized that there may be points on the\nmap where this information may not be enough for Principia to uniquely determine its current\nlocation. This is because there might be two (or more) different points from which the\ninformation looks the same. Points with this property are callednon-distinguishable, while\nall other points are calleddistinguishable.\nFormally, the information retrieved by Principia when located at point (x, y)\nis Info(x, y) := the set of all points (z - x, w - y), where (z, w) is the location\nof a repair center and |z - x| + |w - y| \u2264D. Here\n|z - x| and |w - y| denote the absolute values of z - x and w - y, respectively.\nA point (x1, y1) is non-distinguishable if and only if\nthere exists another point (x2, y2) such that\nInfo(x1, y1) = Info(x2, y2).\nFor example, supposeD=4 and there are repair centers at points (0, 0) and (5, 0).\nThe point (0, 0) is non-distinguishable because Info(0, 0)={(0, 0)}=Info(5, 0).\nThis means that point (5, 0) is also non-distinguishable. On the other hand,\nInfo(3.5, 0.1)={(-3.5, -0.1), (1.5, -0.1)} is not equal to the information from any other point,\nwhich means that point (3.5, 0.1) is distinguishable. The following picture illustrates the\nregions of distinguishable points (in red) and non-distinguishable points (in blue):\n\nPrincipia is deployed to a point that is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all points\nthat are withinDmeters (using L1distance) of at least one repair center\n\u2014 that is, the set of all points (x, y) such that Info(x, y) is non-empty.\nThe probability of that choice belonging to a given continuous set of points S is\nproportional to the number of square meters of S's area.\nIn the example above, each red square has an area of 4.5 square meters, while each blue section\nhas an area of 23 square meters. Therefore, the probability of Principia being deployed within\neach red square is 4.5/(3\u00d74.5 + 2\u00d723) and the probability of it being deployed\nwithin each blue section is 23/(3\u00d74.5 + 2\u00d723). Since the border between adjacent\ndifferently-colored sections has area equal to 0, the probability of Principia being\ndeployed exactly on the border is exactly 0.\nGiven the locations of all repair centers, what is the probability that the point to which\nPrincipia is deployed is distinguishable?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\nEach test case starts with a line containing two integersNandDrepresenting\n(respectively) the number of repair centers and the maximum L1distance from which\nPrincipia can retrieve information from a repair center, as described above.

The island's coast is modeled as a circle with a\n  circumference ofKkilometers. There is a lighthouse on the coast\n  which occupies a single point on the circle's circumference. Each point on\n  the coast is mapped to a real number in the range [0,K); formally,\n  point x is the point on the coast that is x kilometers away from the\n  lighthouse when walking clockwise along the coast. For example, ifK= 5, point 0 is the point where the lighthouse is, point 1.5 is the\n  point that is 1.5 kilometers away from the lighthouse in the clockwise direction,\n  and point 2.5 is the point that is located at the diametrical opposite of the\n  lighthouse.\nYou are in charge of studying coastal temperatures. Another team installed a\n  coastal temperature measuring system that works as follows: a number of\n  thermometers were deployed at specific points to measure the temperature at\n  those points. No two thermometers were placed at the same point. In that\n  team's model, points without thermometers are assumed to have the same\n  temperature as the one measured by the closest thermometer. For points that\n  are equidistant from two thermometers, the thermometer in the clockwise\n  direction is used (the first one you would encounter if walking clockwise\n  from the point).\nUnfortunately, you do not know how many thermometers the system used or\n  where they were placed, but you do have access to the system's temperature\n  data. It is given as two lists\n  ofNvalues eachX1,X2, ...,XNandT1,T2, ...,TN, representing that each point x whereXi\u2264 x <Xi+1is assigned\n  temperatureTi, for each 1 \u2264 i <N, and each\n  point x where 0 \u2264 x <X1orXN\u2264 x <Kis assigned temperatureTN. The points are enumerated in the clockwise direction,\n  soXi<Xi+1, for all i.\nYou want to determine the smallest number of thermometers\n  that, when placed in some set of locations, could have produced the observed\n  data.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow; each consists of three lines.

The\n  way in which the integers in the second and third line represent the\n  temperatures is explained above.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the minimum number of thermometers that could have produced the observed\n  input data, as described above.\nTime limit: 30 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 \u2264T\u2264 100.2 \u2264N\u2264 min(100,K).0 \u2264X1.Xi<Xi+1, for all i.XN<K.184 \u2264Ti\u2264 330, for all i.Ti\u2260Ti+1, for all i.T1\u2260TN.\n2 \u2264K\u2264 10.\n2 \u2264K\u2264 109.\nIn Sample Case #1, at least 2 thermometers are needed because there are two\n  different temperatures measured. It is possible to produce the data using\n  exactly 2 thermometers, with one thermometer (measuring 184) at point 0.5 and\n  another (measuring 330) at point 1.5. Note that point 0 and point 1 are\n  equidistant from both thermometers, so the thermometer in the clockwise\n  direction is used. The temperature measured at point 0 comes from the\n  thermometer at point 0.5 and the temperature measured at point 1 comes from\n  the thermometer at point 1.5.\n\nThe data from Sample Case #2 could not be produced with just 2 thermometers.\n  It could be produced with 3 thermometers if they were placed at point 0.2,\n  point 1.8, and point 2.8, measuring 184, 330 and 330, respectively. There are\n  other ways to place 3 thermometers that would also yield the input data.\n\nIn Sample Case #3, one way to produce the data with 3 thermometers is to\n  place them at point 0, point 2 and point 8, measuring 330, 184 and 200,\n  respectively.\n\n",

Since the result\n  ends with 0, the sum of the values assigned to both last digits 0 and F\n  must end in 0 as well. Since P[0] and P[F] are different values, their sum cannot\n  be exactly 0. Therefore, P[0] + P[F] must be 10 (in base 16). There are 7 pairs\n  of different digits that accomplish that. P[0] and P[F] cannot both be 8.\n  All 7 pairs lead to an overall sum of 10 (after dropping an overflow 1).\n  Therefore, there are 14 assignments of different digits to 0 and F that lead to a\n  hexacoin. There are 16 \u00d7 15 possible assignments to those digits, so the result is\n  14/240 = 7/120.\nIn Sample Case #2, we need to add the probability of the result being exactly 11\n  to the result of Sample Case #1.\n  The only way that happens is if 0 and F are assigned to\n  0 and 1, in either order. That has a probability of 2/240=1/120, leading to a total\n  of 7/120 + 1/120 = 8/120 = 1/15.\nIn Sample Case #3, notice that regardless of which permutation and pair of numbers\n  the computer chooses from the list, we will add two numbers that end in the same digit.\n  That produces an even result, even after taking it modulo 163. Since the only\n  value in range is odd, we have no hope of mining a hexacoin in this case. Notice that0 2is an invalid representation of the answer becausezwould not be minimum.\n",

You only have a way to, given three of them, find\nout which one is the median, that is, which one is neither the minimum nor the maximum among\nthe three.\nFor example, suppose N} = 5 and you know that:x_1 is the median of \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}x_2 is the median of \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}x_3 is the median of \\{x_3, x_4, x_5\\}\nThen, it is guaranteed that the sorted order of the elements is either\nx_4, x_2, x_1, x_3, x_5 or its reverse x_5, x_3, x_1, x_2, x_4.\nNotice that by knowing only medians, it is impossible to distinguish the order of any list\nfrom its reverse, since the median question has the same result for any three\nelements in both cases.\nYour program will have to find the order of T} lists of N} elements using at most\nQ} median questions in total (or Q} / T} queries per list on average).\nIn each case, finding either the right order or its reverse is considered correct.\nThe order for each case is generated uniformly at random from all possible orders,\nand independently of any other information.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially, the judge will send you a single line containing three integers T}, N}, and\n  Q}: the number of test cases, the number of elements to sort within each test case, and\n  the total number of questions you are allowed across all test cases, respectively.\n  Then, you must process T} test cases. Each test case consists of a series of question exchanges\n  plus an additional exchange to provide the answer.\nFor a question exchange, your program must print a single line containing\n  three distinct integers i, j, k all between 1 and N}, inclusive,\n  which corresponds to asking the judge\"which element is the median of the set\n  \\{x_i, x_j, x_k\\}?\"The judge will respond with a single line containing a single integer L},\n  meaning that the median of that set is x_L} (L} is always equal to\n  one of i, j, or k).\n  If you try to perform a (Q}+1)-th question exchange, the judge will simply output-1.\nOnce you are ready to state the result, print a line containing N} integers\n  representing the indices of the elements in sorted or reverse sorted order.\n  The judge will respond with a single integer1if your answer\n  is correct or-1if it is not. After receiving the judge's answer for the\n  T}-th case, your program must finish in time in order to not receive a Time Limit Exceeded\n  error. In addition, if you print additional information after receiving the result\n  for the T}-th case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted line or invalid values from your\n  program at any moment, the judge will print a single number-1.\n  After the judge prints-1for any of the reasons explained above,\n  it will not print any further output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a-1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error.

Then, it iterates through all elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1), and finds the position `j` of the current element using a while loop. If the current element is less than the previous one, it means that the reversort operation has already been applied to this sublist, so we continue with the next iteration. Otherwise, it applies the reversort operation to the sublist starting from the current position `i` and ending at position `j-1`, increments the cost by the length of the sublist (`j - i + 1`) and checks if the total cost equals the desired cost. If the cost matches, it returns the solution as a string with the case number and the sorted list elements. If no solution is found after checking all elements in the list, it returns \"IMPOSSIBLE\". Finally, it prints the result for each test case.",

Keep it up and we will start going up\nthe aleph numbers.\nIn this problem, a tree is either a single node X, or a node X with two\ntrees attached to it: a left subtree and a right subtree. In both cases, X\nis the root of the tree. If the tree is not a single node,\nthe roots of both the left and right subtrees are the only children of X.\nThere is a set of colors numbered from 0 to N}, inclusive.\nEach node is of exactly one color.\nThere might be zero, one, or  multiple nodes of each\ncolor. Each node of color 0 (white) is a leaf node (that is, it\nhas no children).\nEach node of color i, for 1 <= i <= N}, has exactly 2\nchildren: the left one is color L_i} and the right one is color R_i}.\nThe root of the tree is color 1 (black).\nNote that the tree may have a finite or countably infinite number of nodes.\nFor example, the following picture illustrates a finite tree defined by the lists\nL} = [3, 0, 0] and R} = [2, 0, 2]. Color 2 is blue and color 3 is yellow.\n\nThe distance between two nodes in the tree is the minimum number of steps that are needed to get\nfrom one node to the other. A step is a move from a node to its direct parent or its direct\nchild.\nNodes in the tree are indexed using positive integers. The root has index 1. Then, other\nnodes are indexed using consecutive integers, with nodes with smaller distances to the root being\nindexed\nfirst. For nodes that are equidistant to the root, nodes that are further to the left\nare indexed first. For example, the following picture adds indices to each node in the tree\nwe presented before. Notice that each node's index is independent from its color.\n\nAs another example, the following picture shows the first 33 nodes of an infinite tree\ndefined by the lists L} = [3, 4, 2, 4] and R} = [2, 2, 4, 0].

Printing a D in the Code Jam red uses 0 units of cyan ink, 500000 units of magenta\nink, 450000 units of yellow ink, and 50000 units of black ink.\nTo print a color, a printer must have at least the required amount of ink for each of its 4 color cartridges.\nGiven the number of units of ink each printer has in each cartridge, output any color, defined as\n4 non-negative integers that add up to 10^6, such that all three printers have enough\nink to print it.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}.

The proposed color is using up all of the ink in the\n  cyan, magenta, and yellow cartridges of the first printer and all of the\n  ink in the black cartridge of the last printer. This means that no additional\n  unit of ink could be used from any of the 4 ink colors, so the given\n  sample output is the only possible output for this case.\nIn Sample Case #2, magenta is the only color that both the first and second\n  printers have, so our only chance would be to use 10^6 units of\n  magenta.

This may make some groups of machines\n  isolated from others.\nFormally, we say that a machine m uses a link \\ell if (and only if) \\ell is the highest\n  priority link connected to m.

The `solve()` function takes the number of machines (m) and target number of intranets (k) as arguments, initializes variables for active links, total possible link configurations, and the number of active links. It then iteratively selects the highest priority active link until there are either k or m-k active links. If the number of active links is not equal to k or m-k, it outputs 0 as the answer. Otherwise, it computes the number of ways to assign priorities such that exactly active links are active and the remaining links are not, and returns the result modulo MOD. The main part of the code reads the test cases from standard input and calls `solve()` for each case.",

Furthermore, each sitting player is\nwearing a hat.

The total number of players chosen as geese in this case\n  must be between 2 and 3, because selecting 4 geese would require at\n  least one color to be out of bounds.\n  For cases with 2 geese, the only requirement is that we do not select 2 geese both\n  wearing hats of color 1; all 5 such selections are valid.\n  If choosing 3 geese, the\n  options are [1, 2, 1],  [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2],  [2, 2, 1], or\n   [2, 1, 2].

If at the start of a players' turn, all vertices are\n  red, then that player loses the game and the other player wins the game.\nIn the example game below, Ueli colored vertex 3 red in their first turn.\n  Then, Vreni chose vertex 2 for their turn and colored both it and its neighbor\n  (vertex 1) red. Because all vertices are now red, Ueli loses and Vreni wins.\n\nUeli and Vreni have noticed that it is much easier for Ueli to win this game because he has the\n  first turn. Therefore they have adopted the following procedure: first, Ueli chooses an\n  integer N}. Then, Vreni chooses any tree with N} vertices. And then they start playing\n  as described above, with Ueli taking the first turn.\nVreni is hopeful that being able to choose the tree can help her overcome the disadvantage\n  of going second. Can you demonstrate how Vreni can win games in this setup?\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing an integer,\n  T}, the number of test cases.

The nodes of the tree are numbered 1 through N}.\n  Each line must represent a distinct edge of the tree with 2 integers between\n  1 and N}: the two vertices the edge connects.\n  The edges must represent a tree.\n  The two integers within a line may be in either order, and the N}-1 lines themselves may\n  be in any order.\nAfter that, your program must read a line containing a single integer M}, the number of games\n  that you need to play on this tree. These games are played independently; in other words,\n  all vertices of the tree are blue at the start of each game.\nFor each of the M} games, you need to process some number of exchanges until the game is\n  over. Each exchange consists of a turn from each player.\nFor each exchange, your program must read two lines describing Ueli's turn first.\n  The first of those lines will contain an\n  integer K}, denoting the number of blue vertices to be colored red.\n  The second of those lines will contain K} distinct integers A_1}, A_2}, ..., A_K}\n  describing the blue vertices to be colored red. K} will be at least 1, and each A_i}\n  will be between 1 and N}, inclusive. Vertices A_2}, A_3}, ..., A_K} will all be\n  neighbors of vertex A_1}.\nAfter that, your program must output Vreni's choice for their turn in the same format:\n  the first line with the number of blue vertices to be colored red, followed by the second\n  line with the numbers of those vertices, in such an order that all vertices\n  except the first one are neighbors of the first one.\nIf all vertices are red after Vreni's turn, it means that Vreni has won and this game is over.\n  The next game starts immediately if there is one. If this was the last game for this test case,\n  then the next test case starts immediately if there is one. If this was the last test case,\n  the judge will send no further input to your program, and the program must send no further output.\nOn the other hand, if all vertices are red after Ueli's move,\n  it means that Vreni has lost and therefore your program did not pass the test case.\n  In this case, instead of starting a new exchange by printing the last move\n  that colors all remaining blue vertices red, the judge will print a single number -1\n  and will not print any further output, and will not process any further games or test cases.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted or invalid line (like outputting an\n  unexpected number of integers, or integers out of range, or outputting a set of edges\n  that do not form a tree, or trying to color a vertex\n  that is already red, or trying to color a vertex that is not a neighbor of the first\n  vertex colored in this turn) from your program at any moment, the judge\n  will also print a single number -1 and will not print any further output.\n  If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a -1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error.

No identification with actual persons is intended or should be inferred.\nIt is 1935 and a meeting between two Nobel prize winners is producing astonishing results.\nSchr\u00f6dinger, a famous physicist, invited Pavlov, a famous physiologist, to see his experiments\nwith cats in boxes. Pavlov brought his dog with him to keep up with his own\nresearch, and the combination proved interesting, to say the least.\nSchr\u00f6dinger had a row of N} boxes. Some boxes definitely contain a cat, some boxes definitely\ndo not contain a cat, and some boxes may or may not contain a cat. Each box is only big enough\nto hold a single cat. Each box is also equipped with a special quantum tunnel, that allows\nthe cat in the box to move to some other specific box if the destination was empty. The tunnels\nwork in a single direction.\nCats are usually mellow and quiet and do not use the tunnels unless they become startled. When a\nthird unannounced guest rings the bell, Pavlov's dog gets excited immediately and starts\nrunning and barking. The dog starts at box 1 and runs towards box N}. \nAs the dog runs, it passes right next to each box, one at a time. When\nit passes next to a box that contains a cat, the cat in that box becomes startled. The\nstartled cat checks the available tunnel and, if the destination box is empty, uses it to escape.\nIf the destination box is occupied, the cat stays in its current box. The same cat can be startled\nmore than once if they move to a box the dog will get to afterwards, and will proceed in the same\nway every time it is startled (using only the newly available tunnel each subsequent time).\n\nAfter Pavlov's dog finally stops right next to the last box, Pavlov asks Schr\u00f6dinger whether\nthere is a cat in that last box. Schr\u00f6dinger, true to his fame, replies that he does not know.\nPavlov notices that the answer may depend on whether or not there were cats in the unknown boxes.\nMoreover, he also notices that because there are k unknown boxes, there are 2^k\npossibleinitial configurations, one for each combination of statuses of the unknown\nboxes. Pavlov tells Schr\u00f6dinger that they should try to calculate how\nmany of the 2^k initial configurations would result in having a cat in the last box. You are\nasked to recreate that calculation. Since the output can be a really big number, we only ask you to\noutput the remainder of dividing the result by the prime 10^9+7 (1000000007).\nNeither cats, nor dogs, nor Nobel prize winners were harmed in the making of this problem\n  statement.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}. T} test cases follow, each\ndescribed by exactly three lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer\nN}, the number of boxes in Schr\u00f6dinger's experiment. Boxes are numbered between 1\nand N}, in the order Pavlov's dog passes them by. The second line of a test case\ncontains a single string S} of N} characters. The i-th character of S} (counting\nfrom left to right) represents the contents of box i: it is an\nuppercase 'C' if the box contains a cat, a period '.' if the\nbox does not contain a cat and a question mark '?' if it is unknown whether\nthe box contains a cat or not. The third line of a test case contains N} integers\nB_1}, B_2}, ..., B_N}, representing that there is a tunnel going out of box i\nand into box B_i}, for all i.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y,\nwhere x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of initial\nconfigurations that would result\nin a cat being in the last box and unable to escape despite hearing the barking, modulo the prime\n 10^9+7 (1000000007).\nTime limit: 10 seconds.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 <= T} <= 1234.the length of S} = N}.Each character of S} is either an upper case 'C', a period '.' or\n  a question mark '?'.1 <= B_i} <= N}, for all i.B_i} != i, for all i.\n1 <= N} <= 100.i - 5 <= B_i} <= i + 5, for all i.\n  (All tunnels connect to nearby boxes.)\n1 <= N} <= 5000.\nSample Case #1 is illustrated in the problem statement. There are 4 possible configurations:...C: the dog runs through the first 3 boxes without changing anything\n  because there is no cat there. Then, when it gets to the last box, the cat hears it and escapes\n  to box 3. Therefore, there is no cat in the last box in this case.C..C: when the dog barks near box 1, that startles the cat that\n  goes through the tunnel to get to box 2, which was empty. Then, the same cat\n  gets startled again when the dog barks near box 2 and gets to box 3. And when\n  the dog barks next to box 3, the cat hears it and returns to box 1. Therefore,\n  when the dog gets to box 4 and the other cats hears it, box 3 is empty so the\n  cat escapes and the last box ends up empty..C.C: This case is very similar to the previous one. After the dog goes through\n  the first box and nothing happens, the state is the same as before, so the ultimate result\n  is the same: last box empty.CC.C: In this case, the cat in the first box cannot escape when it hears the\n  dog, so it remains in box 1. Then, when the cat in box 2 gets startled it escapes to\n  box 3 leaving a state ofC.CC. When the dog gets to the box 3, the cat\n  currently there cannot escape to box 1 so the state remains the same. Finally, when the\n  dog gets to the last box, the cat that is there cannot escape because box 3 is occupied\n  this time. So, in this case, the last box ends up with a cat after the dog ends its journey.Out of the 4 possibilities, only 1 (the last one) ends up with a cat in the last box,\n  so the answer is 1.\nIn Sample Case #2, the tunnels are set up the same as in Sample Case #1. Since no tunnel ends\n  at the last box, the configurations that start with no cat at the last box will also not end with\n  a cat there, so we do not need to count them. Then, we have 8 additional configurations. The\n  4 we considered for Sample Case #1, out of which only 1 ends up with a cat at the last\n  box. The remaining 4 configurations are:..CC,C.CC,.CCC,CCCC. From these additional 4 configurations, only in the\n  last one listed a cat ends up in the last box, for a total of 2 overall.\nIn Sample Case #3, notice that for a cat to remain in the last box after the dog barks near it,\n  both that box and box 5 must be occupied then (otherwise, either there is no cat in the\n  last box, or it will escape to box 5). Since there is no tunnel going into box 5,\n  a cat must start there. As long as there is another cat in any other box, box 6 will get\n  (or remain) occupied before the cat in box 5 gets an opportunity to escape, so all of those\n  will end up with a cat in the last box. As we argued before, a single cat is not enough. Thus,\n  we need to count the number of configurations with a cat in box 5 and at least one other cat.\n  There are 2^4 configurations with a cat in box 5, and out of those, only 1 has\n  no other cat, so the answer is 2^4-1=15.\nIn Sample Case #4, in all of the 2^k ways in which the k unknown boxes may exist\n  a cat would be left in the last box.\n",

The labyrinth is a set of J} junctions numbered 1 through J},\nconnected by C} bidirectional corridors.\nAlice and the Queen of Hearts take turns making moves, and each knows the location of the other\nat all times. A move (by either of them) consists of either staying at the current junction or moving to\nanother one that is connected to it by a corridor.\nThe Queen's herald, however, announces the next move the Queen makes in advance. That means\nthat before anyone makes a move, he announces the Queen's first move. Then, Alice moves first.\nThen, each time the Queen moves, she must respect the previous announcement, and then decide\nher next move so the herald can announce it. Alice hears the announcements, so she always knows the\nQueen's next move before making her own.\n\nIf Alice and the Queen are at the same junction after either of them moves, then Alice is caught.\nOtherwise, the pursuit continues. After 10^9 total moves (half of them for Alice and half\nfor the Queen), if Alice and the Queen are not in the same junction, then the Queen will give up\nand Alice will be safe.\nAlice chooses her moves optimally to escape.

Alice has to move before then. If Alice moves to where the Queen already is, she gets\n  caught immediately; if Alice remains in place, then she gets caught when the Queen moves.
