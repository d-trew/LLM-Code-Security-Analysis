This Python program generates a network design with N computers, where each computer is assigned a unique integer between 1 and N. It then shuffles the IDs using a random permutation and sends the shuffled network to the judge. The program recreates the original permutation by finding a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the given and shuffled network, ensuring that it can recover the original identifying integers without having access to any information other than the existing direct links. If the original and shuffled networks are different, the program will not pass the test.
