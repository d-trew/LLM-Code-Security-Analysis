This program reads the number of test cases from the input and then iterates through each case. For each case, it calculates the edit distance between the proposed names using the `edit_distance` function and finds a compromise name using the `find_compromise` function. The compromise name is found by iterating over both strings and adding characters that are common or missing from one of the original names, ensuring that the resulting compromise name meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
