This Python code reads the number of test cases T and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it first reads the number of vertices N, then reads the edges that form a tree with N vertices. After that, it reads the number of games M to play on this tree. The program plays the game by simulating Ueli's moves and Vreni's responses until the game is over or all vertices are red. If the game is not won by Vreni, it prints -1 and stops processing further games or test cases.
