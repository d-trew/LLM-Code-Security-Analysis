This Python code reads the input from stdin and outputs the minimum number of ducks that might have infiltrated the conference for each test case. The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the center of the conference floor to every attendee at every second up to the time when the first meeting starts, then checks if a hypothesis where all attendees are geese is feasible by checking if the statements in the input are consistent with that hypothesis. If not, it tries making one attendee a duck and checks again until it finds a feasible hypothesis or runs out of attendees to make ducks.
