Here's a Python solution for the problem you described:


from itertools import combinations, count

def max_jugglers(R, B):
    if R == 0 or B == 0:
        return 1
    max_red = max(R, B)
    min_red = min(R, B)
    jugglers = []
    for i in range(max_red, 0, -1):
        red_combs = combinations([i] * R, 2)
        blue_combs = combinations(range(min_red, B + 1), 2)
        if len(list(filter(lambda x: sum(x) == min_red and set(x[0]) != set(x[1]), red_combs)) > 0 and \
                len(list(filter(lambda x: sum(x) == min_blue, blue_combs))) > 0:
            jugglers.append([i for i in range(R)] + [j for j in range(B)])
            break
    else:
        jugglers = []
    return len(max(jugglers, key=len)) if jugglers else 0

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    R, B = map(int, input().split())
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(_ + 1, max_jugglers(R, B)))


This solution uses the itertools.combinations function to generate all possible combinations of red and blue chainsaws for each juggler, ensuring that no two jugglers have the same number of chainsaws. It then checks if there exists a valid combination that satisfies the audience's demands. If a valid combination is found, it adds the corresponding list of numbers representing the distribution of chainsaws to the `jugglers` list. Finally, it returns the length of the maximum-length list in `jugglers`, or 0 if no valid combinations were found.
