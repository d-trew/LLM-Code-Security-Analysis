This code reads the number of test cases, then iterates through each case. For each test case, it first reads the number of workers, broken workers, and the maximum number of lines to send. It then simulates sending lines to the database and keeps track of the broken workers by checking if the line contains a '1' at its corresponding index. After sending the required number of lines or reaching a line with only '1', it calls the `test_store` function to get the remaining bits and prints the IDs of the broken workers in sorted order. If the answer is correct, it prints '1' and moves on to the next test case.
