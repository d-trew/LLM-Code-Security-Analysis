This program takes the number of test cases as input and then iterates through each case. For each case, it checks if the total number of balls matches the number of columns, if not it prints IMPOSSIBLE and moves on to the next case. If the total number of balls is equal to the number of columns, it initializes a 2D grid with all cells empty. Then, for each ball in the bottom row, it checks if the current cell can hold a ramp or not based on the rules given in the problem statement. After placing the balls and ramps, it checks if the grid is valid by checking that every cell except the leftmost and rightmost columns and the top row are either empty or contain a ramp. If the grid is valid, it prints the number of rows and the grid itself, otherwise it prints IMPOSSIBLE.
