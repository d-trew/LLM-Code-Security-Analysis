This Python program takes input and output according to the given description. It reads a single line containing an integer, T, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines: one containing N integers that represent the set A, and another line containing N distinct integers from set B. The program then computes a solution for each test case by iterating through the sets A and B to find a subset with equal sums, and outputs the chosen integers as the first subset. The program continues until it has processed all test cases.
