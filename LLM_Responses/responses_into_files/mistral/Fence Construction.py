solve()


This Python program reads the number of test cases T from the standard input and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of fences F and the number of fences K given by the director. It then reads the coordinates of all the fences into a list called `fences`. The fences are sorted based on whether they were provided in the director's ordering or not. This is done to ensure that the fences provided by the director appear first in the list.

The function `is_valid` checks if a given ordering of the fences is valid, i.e., it ensures that no fence intersects with any other fence and that the printer can move from one fence to another without intersecting any previously built fences. This function also checks that each fence appears only once in the ordering.

The `solve` function iterates through all possible orderings of the fences using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module and filters out invalid orderings using the `is_valid` function. If there are no valid orderings, it prints "No solution" for that test case. Otherwise, it prints the first valid ordering found.
