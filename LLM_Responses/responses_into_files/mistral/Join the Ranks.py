This Python code solves the problem as described. It first reads the number of test cases from the input and then iterates through each test case using a for loop. For each test case, it calculates the total number of cards in the deck (R \* S) and initializes an empty list called "operations".

Next, it sorts the ranks and creates a dictionary to map ranks to their indices. Then, for each rank in the sorted ranks, it calculates the starting index and ending index of the cards with that rank using the inverse rank-to-index dictionary created earlier. If the starting index is less than the ending index, it adds the pair (starting index, ending index) to the "operations" list.

Finally, it prints the number of operations required for each test case and the sequence of operations as per the problem description.
