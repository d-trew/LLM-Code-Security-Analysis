Here's a Python solution for the described problem:


def reversort(n, c):
    if n <= 0 or c < 0 or c > (n*(n-1))//2:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"

    # Initialize list with all integers from 1 to n in order
    nums = list(range(1, n+1))
    cost = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        j = nums[i]
        while nums[j-1] > j:
            nums[j], nums[j-1] = nums[j-1], nums[j]
            cost += (j - i + 1)
            if cost == c:
                return "Case #{}: {}".format(i+1, ' '.join(str(x) for x in nums))
        j -= 1
    return "IMPOSSIBLE"

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(reversort(n, c))


This code reads the number of test cases `T`, then for each test case it initializes a list of numbers from 1 to `n` in order and sets the cost to zero. Then, it iterates through all elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1), and finds the position `j` of the current element using a while loop. If the current element is less than the previous one, it means that the reversort operation has already been applied to this sublist, so we continue with the next iteration. Otherwise, it applies the reversort operation to the sublist starting from the current position `i` and ending at position `j-1`, increments the cost by the length of the sublist (`j - i + 1`) and checks if the total cost equals the desired cost. If the cost matches, it returns the solution as a string with the case number and the sorted list elements. If no solution is found after checking all elements in the list, it returns "IMPOSSIBLE". Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
