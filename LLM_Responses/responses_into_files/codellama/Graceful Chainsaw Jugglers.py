This program uses the concept of ceiling division to find the largest number of jugglers that can be used in a show while satisfying the audience's demands.
The function `largest_number_of_jugglers` takes two parameters: R and B, which represent the numbers of red chainsaws and blue chainsaws respectively.
If R or B is 0, the function returns 0. If R = 1 and B = 1, the function returns 2. Otherwise, it uses ceiling division to find the largest number of jugglers that can be used in a show while satisfying the audience's demands.
The main program reads the input, which consists of a single line with two integers R and B representing the numbers of red chainsaws and blue chainsaws respectively. It then calls the function `largest_number_of_jugglers` to find the largest number of jugglers that can be used in a show while satisfying the audience's demands, and prints the result with a header "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the largest number of jugglers that can be used in the show.
