This is a complex problem that involves geometry and convex hull algorithms, which are typically solved using Graham's scan or Jarvis's march algorithm for finding the convex hull of points in a plane. However, this problem is more complicated because it requires not only the convex hull but also the condition that no three column bases were ever collinear and no four column tips were ever coplanar.

The Python code below uses a variant of Graham's scan algorithm to solve the problem. It sorts the columns by their x-coordinate, then processes them in order from left to right, updating the convex hull as it goes along. The code also checks for collinearity and coplanarity at each step:


import sys
from collections import namedtuple
from math import sqrt

Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y z')

def orientation(p, q, r):
    return (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x)

def distance(p, q):
    return sqrt((p.x - q.x)**2 + (p.y - q.y)**2)

def ccw(p, q, r):
    return orientation(p, q, r) < 0

def collinear(p, q, r):
    return orientation(p, q, r) == 0

def coplanar(p, q, r, s):
    return (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - q.y) == (r.x - q.x)*(s.y - r.y) and \
           (q.y - p.y)*(r.z - q.z) == (r.y - q.y)*(s.z - r.z)

def solve():
    n = int(input().strip())
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
        points.append(Point(x, y, z))
    
    points.sort()
    hull = []
    for p in points:
        while len(hull) >= 2 and not ccw(hull[-2], hull[-1], p):
            if collinear(hull[-2], hull[-1], p):
                return False  # Collinearity violation
            hull.pop()
        hull.append(p)
    
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while len(hull) >= 3 and not ccw(hull[-3], hull[-2], hull[-1]):
            if coplanar(hull[-3], hull[-2], hull[-1], points[i]):
                return False  # Coplanarity violation
            hull.pop()
        hull.append(points[i])
    
    return [p for p in hull if p not in points] == []

t = int(input().strip())
for i in range(1, t + 1):
    print("Case #{}:".format(i), end=' ')
    if solve():
        print(' '.join(map(str, range(1, len(hull) + 1))))
    else:
        print("IMPOSSIBLE")

This code assumes that the columns are given in order from left to right. If they're not, you can sort them by x-coordinate first or use a different algorithm to handle the case where columns overlap in their build order.
