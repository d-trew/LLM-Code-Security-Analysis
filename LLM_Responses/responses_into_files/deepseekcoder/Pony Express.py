This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm with some modifications. The basic idea is to treat each city as a node and each route as an edge in a graph. For each horse, we have a speed which acts like the weight of the edges in the graph. We then use Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph but instead of finding the shortest path between two nodes, we find the minimum time it takes to deliver mail from one city to another.

Here is the Python code for this problem:


import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = [float('inf')] * len(graph)
    distances[start] = 0
    queue = [(0, start)]
    while queue:
        dist, node = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if dist != distances[node]: continue
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
            old_dist = distances[neighbor]
            new_dist = dist + weight
            if new_dist < old_dist:
                distances[neighbor] = new<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.dist = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(queue, (new_dist, neighbor))
    return distances

def solve():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(1, T + 1):
        N, E, S = map(int, input().split())
        horses = list(map(int, input().split()))
        graph = [{} for _ in range(N)]
        for i in range(N - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                d = int(input())
                if d != -1:
                    graph[i][j] = graph[j][i] = d / (horses[i] + horses[j])
        deliveries = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(S)]
        distances = dijkstra(graph, 0)
        times = [distances[u - 1] * horses[v - 1] if u < v else distances[v - 1] * horses[u - 1] for u, v in deliveries]
        print('Case #{}: {}'.format(t, ' '.join(map(str, times))))

solve()

This code reads the input data and constructs a graph. Then it runs Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph to find the shortest paths from the start city (city 1) to all other cities. The time for each delivery is then calculated by multiplying the distance to that city with the speed of the horse in that city.
