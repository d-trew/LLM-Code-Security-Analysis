Here's a Python program that follows the problem description:


import sys
from random import choices

def solve(flavors, preferences):
    sold = [False] * len(flavors)
    for pref in preferences:
        if all(choices([0, 1], weights=[1 - p, p], k=len(pref)) for p in pref):
            for f in sorted(range(len(pref)), key=lambda i: pref[i]):
                if not sold[f]:
                    sold[f] = True
                    return f
    return -1

T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    preferences = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(N)]
    print(solve([], preferences))

This program reads the number of test cases and then processes each one. For each case, it reads the number of lollipops (and customers) and the customer's preferences. It then calls a function `solve` that tries to sell a flavor to each customer based on their preferences. The solve function uses Python's built-in `choices` function to simulate random liking of flavors by the customers. If all customers have been served, it returns -1.
