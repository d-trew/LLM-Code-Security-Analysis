It seems like this problem is more related to algorithm design rather than a specific Python programming task. However, I can provide a basic structure of how the program might be structured based on your description. This code will not solve all cases due to the nature of the problem and it's likely that you would need a more sophisticated algorithm for optimal results.


import sys
from collections import deque

# Read input data from judge
T, N, B, P = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
towers = [deque() for _ in range(N)]
scores = []

for _ in range(T * N):
    D = int(sys.stdin.readline())  # digit printed on the block to be placed
    
    max_score = 0
    max_tower_index = -1
    
    for i, tower in enumerate(towers):
        if len(tower) < B:  # we can place the block here
            score = int(''.join([str(D)] + [str(b) for b in tower]))
            if score > max_score:
                max_score = score
                max_tower_index = i
    
    if max_tower_index == -1:  # no valid towers, output -1 and exit
        print(-1)
        sys.exit(0)
        
    towers[max_tower_index].appendleft(D)
    scores.append(max_score)
    
# Output the total score
print(sum(scores)) if sum(scores) >= P else print(-1)

This code reads the number of test cases, towers and blocks from the judge's input. For each block to be placed, it finds a tower with less than B blocks (to avoid rotating digits). The score is calculated as the integer formed by concatenating the digit D with the existing digits in the tower. If no valid tower is found, -1 is outputted and the program exits. Otherwise, the block is added to the selected tower and its score is appended to a list of scores. Finally, if the total score is greater or equal to P, it's printed; otherwise, -1 is outputted.
