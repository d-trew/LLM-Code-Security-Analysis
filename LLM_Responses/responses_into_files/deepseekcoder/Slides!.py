It seems like you're looking for a solution that involves graph theory and dynamic programming. However, it's important to note that this problem is NP-complete, meaning there isn't an algorithm with polynomial time complexity that can solve all instances of the problem. Therefore, creating a Python program based on your description would be quite complex and may not run efficiently for large inputs.

However, here's a simplified version of what you might do if B were small (like 5 or 6):


def solve(B, M):
    dp = [0] * (1 << B)
    dp[0] = 1
    for mask in range(1 << B):
        bit_count = bin(mask).count('1')
        if bit_count >= M:
            continue
        for b in range(B):
            if ((mask >> b) & 1) == 0 and (((mask >> (b + 1)) & 1) == 1 or b == B - 1):
                new_mask = mask | (1 << b)
                dp[new_mask] += dp[mask]
    return dp[-1] % M

This code uses dynamic programming and bit manipulation to solve the problem. It creates a list `dp` where each index corresponds to a binary representation of a subset of buildings, and the value at that index is the number of ways to reach that state using the slides. The outer loop iterates through all possible masks (subsets) of buildings, and the inner loop sets up new states by adding one building at a time.

However, even this simplified version would be too slow for B > 6 or M > 20 due to its complexity. For B <= 5 and M <= 20, you can use the above code as is. If B > 6 or M > 20, you'll need an algorithm that's more efficient than exponential time (like using matrix exponentiation), which isn't feasible with a simple Python program.
