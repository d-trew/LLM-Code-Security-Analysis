Here's a Python program based on the problem description. This program sorts a list of distinct integers in strictly increasing order by swapping elements and querying for minimum values from ranges. The number of coins per test case is limited to 6 * 10^8, as specified in the problem statement.

Please note that this code assumes you have access to an interactive environment where you can send queries and receive responses. This might be a part of a larger system or a separate script for testing purposes:


import math

def get_min(i, j):
    coins = math.ceil(10**8 / (j - i + 1))
    if coins > remaining_coins[testcase]:
        return None
    print(f"Q {i} {j}")
    response = int(input())
    remaining_coins[testcase] -= coins
    return response

def solve():
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_pos = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_pos]:
                min_pos = j
        # Swap element at position i with the minimum element found
        if i != min_pos:
            coins_needed = 0
            for k in range(i+1, n):
                query_result = get_min(i+1, k)
                if query_result is not None and arr[query_result] < arr[i]:
                    min_pos = k
            if min_pos != i:
                print(f"S {i} {min_pos}")
                arr[i], arr[min_pos] = arr[min_pos], arr[i]

T, N = map(int, input().split())
remaining_coins = [600000000 for _ in range(T)]  # Initialize with maximum coins per test case
for testcase in range(T):
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    solve()
    print("D")  # Signal that we are done

This code first defines a function `get_min` to query the minimum value within a range. It then uses this function in the main `solve` function to find the minimum of each subarray and swap it with the current element if necessary. After all swaps, it signals that we are done by printing "D".
