This problem can be solved using breadth-first search (BFS). Alice's aim is to maximize her escape time while the Queen tries to minimize her time in capture. This suggests that both players should take optimal actions at each step, which means they should follow the strategy of minimax decision making. The key here is that since Alice and the Queen have different strategies, we need to run two separate BFSs from their respective starting points.

Here's a Python code snippet that implements this approach:


from collections import deque
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def bfs(start):
    visited, cnt = [0]*(J+1), [0]*(J+1)
    queue = deque([start])
    visited[start], cnt[start] = 1, 1
    
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()
        for nxt in adj_list[curr]:
            if not visited[nxt]:
                visited[nxt] = 1
                cnt[nxt] = cnt[curr] + 1
                queue.append(nxt)
    return cnt

T = int(input())
for t in range(1, T+1):
    J, C, A, Q = map(int, input().split())
    
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(J+1)]
    for _ in range(C):
        U, V = map(int, input().split())
        adj_list[U].append(V)
        adj_list[V].append(U)
    
    Alice = bfs(A)
    Queen = bfs(Q)
    
    max_Alice = 0
    for i in range(1, J+1):
        if Alice[i] > Alice[max_Alice]:
            max_Alice = i
    
    min_Queen = max_Alice
    for i in range(1, J+1):
        if Queen[i] < Queen[min_Queen]:
            min_Queen = i
    
    if Alice[max_Alice] == Queen[min_Queen]:
        print("Case #{}: {}".format(t, max_Alice))
    else:
        print("Case #{}: {}".format(t, max(Alice)+1))

This code first reads the input data and sets up an adjacency list for each junction. Then it runs two BFSs from Alice's starting point (A) and Queen's starting point (Q), respectively. The results of these BFSs are stored in the lists `Alice` and `Queen`, where `Alice[i]` is the minimum number of moves required by Alice to reach junction i while `Queen[i]` is the maximum number of moves required by the Queen to reach junction i. The code then finds the junction that requires the most moves for Alice (max_Alice) and the least moves for the Queen (min_Queen). If Alice's max_Alice equals the min_Queen, it means they are in the same position after an equal number of turns so Alice will be caught. Otherwise, Alice can escape by moving to the junction with the maximum number of moves in `Alice` list plus one more turn for herself.
