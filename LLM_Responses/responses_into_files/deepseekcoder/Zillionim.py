Here is a Python code snippet based on your description. This program simulates the game by removing a random set of 10 consecutive numbers from a list representing the coins, and then checks if there are any valid moves left. If not, it means that the player has lost. The AI always gets the first turn.


import random

def remove_coins(lst, start, end):
    del lst[start:end]

def valid_moves(lst):
    return [i for i in range(10) if len(lst[i:i+10]) == 10]

def game():
    coins = list(range(1, 1013))
    while True:
        start = random.choice(valid_moves(coins))
        remove_coins(coins, start, start+10)
        if not valid_moves(coins):
            return 'AI'
        start = random.choice(valid_moves(coins[::-1]))
        remove_coins(coins[::-1], start, start+10)
        if not valid_moves(coins):
            return 'Player'

def main():
    t = int(input())
    wins = {'AI': 0, 'Player': 0}
    for _ in range(t):
        result = game()
        print('10')
        wins[result] += 1
        if wins['Player'] >= w or wins['AI'] >= w:
            break
    print(wins)


Please note that this is a simple simulation and does not take into account the complexities of Zillionim. It's always better to use real game rules and strategies for such games. The AI in this program is very weak, it just makes random moves. A more sophisticated AI would be able to predict when it can make a winning move and block the opponent from making one.
