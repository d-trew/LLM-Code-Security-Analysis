I'm sorry, but it seems like there is a misunderstanding or confusion in your description. It appears to be an interactive problem where Python code needs to interact with an external process (the judge). However, without further information on how the interaction should work, I can only provide a basic template for handling inputs and outputs in Python. Here's a simple way to handle this:


import sys

def main():
    T = int(input())  # read number of test cases
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(input())  # read minimum required area
        for _ in range(1000):  # max number of interactions
            print('10 10')  # example coordinates to prepare a cell
            sys.stdout.flush()
            
            I, J = map(int, input().split())  # read response from judge
            if (I, J) == (0, 0):  # end of test case
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This Python script reads the number of test cases and for each test case it prepares a cell at coordinates (10, 10). It then waits for the response from the judge. If the judge sends back `(0, 0)`, it means that the end of the test case has been reached.

Please note that this is just a basic template and may need to be adjusted based on the actual problem requirements. Also, you'll need to implement the logic for choosing the cell coordinates (I, J) according to your strategy. This will depend on how the gopher should choose cells to prepare. 

Remember to flush the output buffer using `sys.stdout.flush()` after printing the coordinates so that they are sent immediately to the judge. If you don't do this, the coordinates might be buffered and not sent to the judge before the program reads them from the input stream again.
