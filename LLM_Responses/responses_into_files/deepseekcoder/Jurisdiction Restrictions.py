This problem is about optimizing the distribution of police stations in a grid-based city, considering their patrol range and the number of blocks they can cover. It's a complex optimization problem that involves some concepts from graph theory and geometry. Here's a basic Python solution for it using brute force approach:


import sys
from itertools import combinations

def distance(a, b):
    return max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[1] - b[1]))

def solve():
    R, C, S = map(int, input().split())
    stations = []
    for _ in range(S):
        r, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        stations.append((r-1, c-1))  # Adjusting to zero indexed
    
    blocks_assigned = [0]*S
    min_diff = sys.maxsize
    
    for comb in combinations(range(R*C), S):
        for i in range(S):
            if distance((comb[i]//C, comb[i]%C), stations[i]) > d:
                break
        else:  # No station is more than D blocks away from the block.
            diff = max(blocks_assigned) - min(blocks_assigned)
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
    
    return min_diff if min_diff != sys.maxsize else "IMPOSSIBLE"

T = int(input())
for t in range(1, T+1):
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(t, solve()))

This code is a brute force solution that checks all possible combinations of blocks assignment to stations. It uses the `itertools` library's `combinations` function to generate all possible block assignments. For each combination, it calculates the maximum and minimum number of assigned blocks for each station and updates the minimal difference if necessary.

Please note that this solution is not efficient for large inputs due to its time complexity of O(nCr), where n=R*C and r=S (number of stations). It may take a long time to finish when R, C are very large or S is close to the maximum possible value. You might need to use more sophisticated algorithms or heuristics for such cases.
