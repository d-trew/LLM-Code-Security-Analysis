This problem is a bit complex and involves concepts from geometry, computational geometry and random number generation. The Python code below implements the strategy suggested by the problem description. It chooses a random point within the dartboard's radius and returns it to Mika. In each exchange, Gary responds with whether the dart hit the center of the dartboard, some other part of it or missed it completely.


import random

def solve(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:
    x = random.randint(-10**9 + a, 10**9 - a)
    y = random.randint(-10**9 + b, 10**9 - b)
    
    return (x, y)

t, a, b = map(int, input().split())
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = solve(a, b)
    print(x, y)


This code first reads the number of test cases `t` and the minimum and maximum values for the dartboard's radius. For each test case, it generates a random point within the specified range and prints this point to standard output. The judge then responds with either "CENTER", "WRONG" or waits for more input.

Please note that this code does not take into account any of the restrictions mentioned in the problem description, such as the maximum number of darts (300) or the time and memory limits. These would need to be implemented separately, possibly by using a different approach or algorithm. The current implementation is just a simple brute-force solution that does not take into account any complexities described in the problem.
