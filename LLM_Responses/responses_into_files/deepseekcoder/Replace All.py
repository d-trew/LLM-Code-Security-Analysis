Here is a Python solution for this problem using recursion and set operations to find the maximum number of unique characters in the final text after performing all implemented replacements to an initial string one or more times each, in some order:


def replace_chars(s, replacements):
    if not replacements:
        return {s[-1]}
    
    last = set()
    for r in replacements.keys():
        if r in s:
            new_str = s.replace(r, replacements[r])
            last |= replace_chars(new_str, {k: v for k, v in replacements.items() if k != r})
    
    return last

t = int(input())  # number of test cases
for case in range(1, t + 1):
    s, n = input().split(' ')  # initial string and number of implemented replacements
    n = int(n)
    replacements = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = input().split(' ')  # replacement pairs
        replacements[a] = b
    
    unique_chars = replace_chars(s, replacements)
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(case, len(unique_chars)))

This solution uses recursion to try all possible combinations of replacement operations on the string. It keeps track of the unique characters in each step and returns a set of these at the end of the recursive call. The final result is the maximum number of unique characters among all returned sets. Each test case is processed independently, with the results being printed out in the required format.
