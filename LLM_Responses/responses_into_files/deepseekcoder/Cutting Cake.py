Here's the Python code for this problem based on your description:


def solve(N, W, H, P, Q, R, S, patches):
    # Calculate area of each patch and total enjoyment from all patches
    areas = []
    enjoyments_A = []
    enjoyments_B = []
    for Xi, Yi, Ai, Bi in patches:
        x1 = Xi
        y1 = Yi
        x2 = Xi + P
        y2 = Yi + Q
        x3 = Xi + R
        y3 = Yi + S
        area = 0.5 * abs((x2 - x1)*(y3 - y1) - (x3 - x1)*(y2 - y1))  # Calculate triangle area using cross product
        enjoyment_A = Ai * area / ((P + R) * (Q + S))   # Enjoyment from eating a part of the patch
        enjoyment_B = Bi * area / ((P + R) * (Q + S))   # Enjoyment from your twin eating a part of the patch
        areas.append(area)
        enjoyments_A.append((x1, x2, enjoyment_A))
        enjoyments_B.append((x1, x2, enjoyment_B))
    enjoyments_A.sort()  # Sort by starting point
    enjoyments_B.sort()
    
    # Calculate cumulative sum of enjoyments from left to right
    cumsum_A = [0] * (N + 1)
    cumsum_B = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        cumsum_A[i+1] = cumsum<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>_A[i] + enjoyments_A[i][2]
        cumsum_B[i+1] = cumsum<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>_B[i] + enjoyments_B[i][2]
    
    # Calculate minimum difference in total enjoyments
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(N):
        diff = abs(cumsum_A[i+1] - cumsum_B[-i-2])  # Sum of enjoyments on left side and right side after cut
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
