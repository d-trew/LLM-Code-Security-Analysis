Here's the Python code for this problem. It uses dynamic programming to solve it. The idea is that we keep track of the maximum number of polygons at each step and update it based on whether adding another polygon can increase the total number of sides or not.


import sys

# Pre-calculate the maximum possible number of polygons for every valid side count
max_polygons = [0] * 1001
for i in range(2, len(max_polygons)):
    max_polygons[i] = 1 + max((i - j*(j-4)//2 for j in range(int((i*8+9)**.5), 3, -1)))

# Read the number of test cases from standard input
T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for t in range(1, T + 1):
    # Read the total number of sides from standard input
    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    
    # Print the maximum number of polygons for this side count
    print('Case #{}: {}'.format(t, max_polygons[N]))

This code assumes that the input is coming from standard input and it reads one integer per line. The first line should be the total number of test cases (T). Each of the following T lines should contain a single integer representing the target total number of sides for each case. It then calculates and prints out the maximum number of polygons that can be part of a matrygon with exactly N sides, as per your specifications.
