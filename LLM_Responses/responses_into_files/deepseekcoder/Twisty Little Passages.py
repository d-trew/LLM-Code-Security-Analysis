It seems like a complex problem with a lot of constraints and requirements. The problem is about estimating the number of passages in a cave based on room operations. It requires knowledge of random processes, graph theory, and statistics. Here's a simplified Python code snippet that might help you get started:


import sys
from collections import defaultdict
import random

T = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    rooms = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(K+1):
        R_i, P_i = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        if i == 0:
            start = R_i
        else:
            rooms[R_i].append(P_i)
    print(random.choice(rooms[start]))

This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case it reads the room and operation count, along with the room and passage information. It selects a random passage from the current room's passages and prints this to stdout. 

Please note that this is just a basic example and doesn't satisfy all the requirements of the problem statement. You would need to implement more complex logic for estimating the number of passages based on the given constraints, which might involve using statistical techniques or other advanced algorithms. This could be quite complex and may require knowledge in probability theory, statistics, graph theory and random processes.
