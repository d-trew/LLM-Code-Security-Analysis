The task at hand is a combinatorics problem with an optimization aspect. The main challenge here is to generate all possible permutations within a given limit and then find a way to sort each of the K arrays using these permutations in such a way that they are sorted non-decreasingly. This can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we try to apply as many of our available permutations as possible to each array until we cannot do so anymore and then move on to the next one.

Here's how you might approach this in Python:


def solve(p, s, k, n):
    # Generate all permutations within given limit
    permutations = [list(range(1, p+1)) for _ in range(k)]
    
    # For each array
    for i in range(n):
        arr = []
        
        # Try to apply as many of our available permutations as possible
        for j in range(len(permutations)):
            if not arr or (arr and max(arr) < min(permutations[j])):
                arr.append(permutations[j].pop())
        
        # If we cannot do so anymore, remove the first permutation from our list
        while len(permutations[-1]) == 0:
            permutations = permutations[:-1]
            
    return [p for p in permutations if p]

Please note that this is a simplified version of your problem and might not cover all edge cases. You need to adapt it according to the exact problem description you provided. Also, generating so many permutations could be computationally expensive depending on the values of P, S, K, N. 

The main idea here is to use a greedy approach where we try to apply as many of our available permutations as possible to each array until we cannot do so anymore and then move on to the next one. This way, we ensure that for each array, we get a sequence of instructions that yield an array sorted in non-decreasing order.
