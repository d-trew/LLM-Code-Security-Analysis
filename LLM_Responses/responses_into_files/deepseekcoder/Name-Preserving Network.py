It seems like this problem is related to a graph theory problem and network design. The input consists of two integers L and U representing the range for number of computers in your network design, followed by N lines containing 2N links between computers. Then, you need to create a network design with N computers and print it out.

Here's a simple Python program that might serve as a starting point:


import sys
from random import shuffle

def read_input():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        L, U = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        links = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(U)]
        yield (L, U, links)

def solve((L, U, links)):
    N = L
    nodes = list(range(1, N + 1))
    shuffle(nodes)
    permutation = {i: j for i, j in zip(nodes, range(1, N + 1))}
    return [N] + [(permutation[a], permutation[b]) for a, b in links[:L]]

def write_output(solution):
    print('\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, pair)) for pair in solution))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for instance in read_input():
        result = solve(instance)
        write_output(result)

This program reads the input from standard input, solves each test case by creating a random permutation and then shuffling the list of nodes to create links. It writes the solution to standard output. Please note that this is just a simple example and does not cover all edge cases or handle errors properly. You might need to adjust it according to your specific requirements.
