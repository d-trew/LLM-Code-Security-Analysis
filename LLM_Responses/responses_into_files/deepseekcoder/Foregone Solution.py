Here is a Python code snippet that solves this problem:


def find_numbers(N):
    strN = str(N)
    for digit in range(2, 10):
        if '4' not in str(digit):
            return (digit, N - digit)
T = int(input())
for tc in range(1, T + 1):
    N = int(input())
    A, B = find_numbers(N)
    print("Case #{}: {} {}".format(tc, A, B))

This code first defines a helper function `find_numbers()` that takes an integer and returns two integers which add up to the original number. It does this by iterating over each digit from 2 through 9 (since we know '4' is not in any of these digits), checking if it contains '4', and returning a pair of numbers where one is the current digit and the other is `N - digit`.

The main part of the code reads the number of test cases from input, then for each test case, it reads the value of N, finds two numbers using `find_numbers()`, and prints out the result in the required format.
