# Sample code for Lisp++ program and queries in Python


def calculateTotalTime(program: str) -> int : # Calculates the total time taken to move cursor through all query positions within a given lisp+ progaram.

    total = 0   ## Initialize sum of times as zero
        for i, j , k  in zip (range1 + K), range2 - L): ## Loops over each pair in queries with start and end postions respectively where we need to calculate the time taken for movement using teleportation or moving right.

            if program[i] == "(" : # Checks if starting position is an opening parenthesis
                total += k  ## If it's a '(' then add K seconds as per description of problem statement
