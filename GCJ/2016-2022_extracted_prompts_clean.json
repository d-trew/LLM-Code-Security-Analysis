For\nexample,101is not a jamcoin; its interpretation in base 2 is 5,\nwhich is prime. But the string1001is a jamcoin: in bases 2\nthrough 10, its interpretation is 9, 28, 65, 126, 217, 344, 513, 730, and 1001,\nrespectively, and none of those is prime.\nWe hear that there may be communities that use jamcoins as a form of currency.\nWhen sending someone a jamcoin, it is polite to prove that the jamcoin is\nlegitimate by including a nontrivial divisor of that jamcoin's interpretation\nin each base from 2 to 10. (A nontrivial divisor for a positive integerKis some positive integer other than 1 orKthat evenly dividesK.) For convenience, these divisors must be expressed in base 10.\nFor example, for the jamcoin1001mentioned above, a possible set\nof nontrivial divisors for the base 2 through 10 interpretations of the jamcoin\nwould be: 3, 7, 5, 6, 31, 8, 27, 5, and 77, respectively.\nCan you produceJdifferent jamcoins of lengthN, along with\nproof that they are legitimate?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow; each consists of one line with two integersNandJ.\nFor each test case, outputJ+1 lines. The first line must consist of\nonlyCase #x:, wherexis the test case number\n(starting from 1). Each of the lastJlines must consist of a jamcoin of\nlengthNfollowed by nine integers. The i-th of those nine integers\n(counting starting from 1) must be a nontrivial divisor of the jamcoin when\nthe jamcoin is interpreted in base i+1.\nAll of these jamcoins must be different. You cannot submit the same jamcoin\nin two different lines, even if you use a different set of divisors each time.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.T= 1.

For example, the Small dataset's input file will\nalways be exactly these two lines:\nSo, you can consider doing some computation before actually downloading an\ninput file and starting the clock.\nIn this sample case, we have used very small values ofNandJfor ease of explanation. Note that this sample case would not appear in either\nthe Small or Large datasets.\nThis is only one of multiple valid solutions. Other sets of jamcoins could have\nbeen used, and there are many other possible sets of nontrivial base 10\ndivisors. Some notes:\n",

They will choose one of those at random\nand operate it for the whole working day.\n If all machines they know how to operate already have an operator, they will not work that day.\n Your goal is to make sure that all machines are being operated each working\nday, regardless of what order the workers arrive in and which machines they choose.\nFor example, suppose there are two workers A and B, and two machines 1 and 2. Suppose\nthat A knows how to operate 1 and 2, and B knows how to operate 1 but not 2.\nIf worker B arrives first, he will pick machine 1, then when worker A arrives she will have\nto choose 2, and the factory will work well. However, if worker A arrives first,\nit might happen that she chooses to operate 1 on that day, and then when worker B arrives\nhe does not have anything to do, leaving machine 2 without an operator, and causing\nyour factory to waste a whole day!\nAs another example, suppose there are two workers A and B, and two machines 1 and 2,\nand that A knows how to operate 1 but not 2, and B does not know how to operate anything. Then,\nregardless of the order in which the workers arrive, the factory will not be able to function well.\nBefore you open your factory, in order to guarantee that the factory will\nconstantly function well, you can teach your workers how to operate machines.\nIt costs one dollar to give a single worker a lesson on how to operate a single\nmachine. Each lesson involves only one worker and only one machine, but you can\nteach any number of lessons to any number of workers, and the same worker can\nreceive multiple lessons. You cannot make a worker forget how to operate a\nmachine if they already know how to operate it.\nFor example, both examples above can be fixed by teaching worker B to operate machine 2.\nIn that case each machine is guaranteed to have an operator every day, regardless of which order the\nworkers arrive in and which machines they choose to operate when they have more than one\npossibility.\nWhat is the minimum amount of dollars you need to spend on training workers to make sure the factory\nfunctions well every day?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.  Each test case starts with one line with an integerN, the number of workers (and machines). This line is followed byNlines with\na string ofNcharacters each. The j-th character on the i-th of those lines is1if the i-th worker knows how to operate the j-th machine, and0otherwise.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1), andyis\na non-negative integer: the minimum amount of dollars you need to spend to make sure that\nallNmachines will always have an operator.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.\n1 ≤N≤ 4.\n1 ≤N≤ 25.\nSample cases #1 and #2 are the ones described in the problem statement.\nIn sample case #3, nobody knows how to do anything! One optimal strategy is to\nteach worker A to operate machine 1, worker B to operate machine 2, and worker\nC to operate machine 3.\nIn sample case #4, no action is necessary. There is only one worker, and the\nworker already knows how to operate the one machine.\nIn sample case #5, worker B already knows how to operate machines 1 and 2. One\noptimal strategy is to teach worker A to operate machine 3, and make A the only\nworker who can operate that machine. But now we have to consider that B might\noperate either machine 1 or 2 upon arrival, so C needs to be able to operate\nthe one not chosen by B. So C must be taught to operate both 1 and 2.\n",

        "problem_statement": "The Go language was designed to have a simple API and to support\nmulti-threading. The Code Jam team wants to push these goals to the limit, so\nwe are proposing a new language called Go++.\nThe Go++ language uses one register, which stores one boolean value (0 or 1).\nThis register is initialized to 0. The language has three instructions:0, which sets the register to 0.1, which sets the register to 1.?, which prints the current register value.Simple, right? To support multi-threading, we allow two different Go++ programs\nto run simultaneously while sharing the one register. Each instruction executes\natomically — that is, one instruction must completely finish before the\nnext instruction can start. However, the two programs may be interleaved in any\nway that preserves the relative order within each program.\nFor example, here are the only six ways in which the two programs1?and?0could be executed together. (The\nunderline on the second program is just to distinguish its instructions from\nthe instructions in the first program.)?01?, which will print01. (Remember that\nthe register is initialized to 0.)?10?, which will print00.?1?0, which will print01.1?0?, which will print10.1??0, which will print11.1??0, which will print11.\nNote that the output string always consists of0s and1s, and never?s, since?is not a state\nthe register can be in.\nUsually, programmers write programs to produce a desired output, but your task\nwill be to write two programs thatwon'tproduce anundesiredoutput! Specifically, you will be given a \"bad\" stringBof lengthL, and a setGofN\"good\" strings, all of\nlengthL.

The factory is located on asteroid 0 in a system\nofNnumbered asteroids. Your getaway ship, the Century Quail, is\nlocated on asteroid 1, and if you can get there, you will be able to fly away\nsafely.\nEach asteroid is a single point in space with a velocity, and you move through\nspace along with whichever asteroid you are currently on. Your Asteroid Jumper\nwill allow you to instantaneously jump between any two asteroids in the system.\nLong jumps are scarier than short ones (and the vacuum of space is terrifying),\nso you want to minimize the maximum distance you need to jump. However,\nstarting now, if you ever spend more than a continuousSseconds without\njumping, the imperial security forces will catch you. That is, the interval\nfrom now until your first jump, and each interval between subsequent jumps,\nmust be less than or equal toS. You may jump atanyinstant;\nit does not have to be after an integer number of seconds have elapsed. You\nescape the instant you jump to asteroid 1.\nThe i-th asteroid starts at position (xi,yi,zi) in space, and it will move a\ntotal distance of (Vxi,Vyi,Vzi) each second. This movement is continuous throughout time;\nit does not update discretely each second. (It is also possible for an\nasteroid to be stationary.) Nothing happens if asteroids occupy the same point\nin space at the same time. You can only travel between two asteroids by\njumping, even if they happen to occupy the same point at the instant of your\njump.\nIn the escape plan that minimizes the maximum jump distance, what is that\nmaximum jump distance?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers:N(the number of asteroids) andS(the limit on how long you can\ngo without jumping). Next, there areNlines describing the asteroids.\nThe i-th of these lines (counting starting from 0) contains six integers: the\ninitial (xi,yi,zi)\nposition of the i-th asteroid in space, and the distance (Vxi,Vyi,Vzi) it moves\nin a single second.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis\na floating-point number: the distance of the longest jump you will have to make\nin order to get away.ywill be considered correct if it is within\nan absolute or relative error of 10-4of the correct answer.

There is another asteroid at (1, 1, 1). One\noption is to jump directly to our ship, which is a distance of 3 away. Another\noption is to jump to the other asteroid, which is a distance of sqrt(3) away,\nand then jump to the ship from there, which is a distance of sqrt(2) away. The\nmaximum jump distance is 3 for the first option and sqrt(3) for the second\noption, so the second option is preferable.\nNote that the value ofSdoes not matter in the Small cases. Since all\nof the asteroids are stationary, there is no reason to wait around; we can make\nall jumps instantaneously.\nIn sample case #2, we start on a stationary asteroid at (0, 0, 0). We can wait\nthere for 4 seconds for asteroid 4 to come very close, jump onto it, fly for 1\nsecond on it, and then jump back at time 5 back to asteroid 0 (the distance\nbetween the two asteroids is 1 at this moment). There we wait 10 seconds,\ncutting it very close to being caught, and then jump to the speeding asteroid 3\nat time 15. Two seconds later, asteroid 3 flies by asteroid 2, and we jump to\nasteroid 2. At time 27, we can jump from asteroid 2 to asteroid 0. There we\npatiently wait until time 35 when asteroid 1 reaches us, then we can jump onto\nit and escape.\nThe longest jump we made was from asteroid 0 to asteroid 3 at time 15, and the\ndistance we jumped was 2.\nIn sample case #3, the security forces are really active! You could, of course,\nwait one second and jump directly to asteroid 1, but a better choice - that\nallows you to make jumps no longer than 4 - is to jump back and forth between\nasteroids 0 and 2; while waiting for asteroid 1 to get close, and only then\njump to it.\n",

        "problem_name": "Ratatouille",
        "problem_statement": "You've discovered it: the ultimate recipe for ratatouille, the famous French\n  dish! You know which ingredients to use, and how many grams of each one to\n  use, in order to make one serving of ratatouille. But you believe that anyone\n  can cook, and so you want to share the recipe with the world... and make some\n  money in the process!\nYou have ordered some ingredient packages that are easy to ship. Each package\n  contains some amount of one ingredient; different packages may have different\n  amounts even if they contain the same ingredient. For convenience, you\n  ordered the same number of packages of each ingredient.\nYou would like to use these packages to form as many ratatouillekitsas possible to send to customers. A kit consists ofexactly onepackage of each ingredient, and a label with the integer number of servings\n  of ratatouille that the kit makes. Since you do not want to shortchange\n  customers or waste food, each package must contain between 90 and 110 percent\n  (inclusive) of the amount of that ingredient that is actually needed to make\n  the number of servings of ratatouille on the kit's label.\nFor example, suppose that one serving of ratatouille takes 500 g of tomato\n  and 300 g of onion. Suppose that you have a 900 g package of tomato and a\n  660 g package of onion. You could form these into a kit that makes two\n  servings of ratatouille. To make two servings, 1000 g of tomato and 600 g of\n  onion are required. Since the 900 g of tomato you have is within [90, 110]%\n  of the 1000 g of tomato required, and the 660 g of onion you have is within\n  [90, 110]% of the 600 g of onion required, this is acceptable. However, you\n  could not say that the kit makes one or three servings of ratatouille, nor\n  could you say that it makes 1.999 servings (the number of servings must be\n  an integer).\nNote that there are some sets of packages that could never form a kit.\n  Continuing with our recipe above, if you have a 1500 g package of tomato and\n  an 809 g package of onion, for example, there is no amount of servings that\n  you can make. Three servings would take 1500 g of tomato and 900 g of onion,\n  and the amount of onion is not within the [90, 110]% range. No other integer\n  amount of servings works, either.\nYou want to share your recipe with as many customers as possible, so you want\n  to produce the maximum number of valid kits. (Of course, each package can be\n  used in at most one kit.) What is the largest number of kits that you can\n  form? Note that you arenotrequired to maximize the total number of\n  servings of ratatouille formed.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each case consists of the following:\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the maximum number of kits you can produce, as described above.\nMemory limit: 1 GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.1 ≤Ri≤ 106, for all i.1 ≤Qij≤ 106, for all i and j.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.1 ≤N≤ 2.1 ≤P≤ 8.\nTime limit: 120 seconds.1 ≤N≤ 50.1 ≤P≤ 50.N×P≤ 1000.\nNote that the last sample case would not appear in the Small dataset.Sample cases #1 and #2 are the ones described in the problem statement.\n\nIn sample case #3, you can form a kit out of the 450 g package of the first\n  ingredient and the 1100 g package of the second ingredient, and say that the\n  kit makes 10 servings of ratatouille. That number of servings requires 500 g\n  of the first ingredient; you have 450 g, which is 90% of 500 and within the\n  allowed limit. It requires 1000 g of the second ingredient; you have 1100 g,\n  which is 110% of 1000 and within the allowed limit.\nOnce you form this kit, however, you cannot form the remaining packages into\n  a kit. 449 g of the first ingredient and 1101 g of the second ingredient\n  would not be able to form 10 (or any other number of) servings. In fact, the\n  (450 g, 1100 g) kit is the only kit that can be formed from these packages.\nIn sample case #4, no kits can be formed. Note that the recipe requires\n  particular amounts of particular ingredientsin the given order; the\n  ingredients are not interchangeable. This is fine French cuisine, after all!\nIn sample case #5, the recipe has only one ingredient — how elegantly\n  simple! A single serving cannot use more than 11 g, and two servings cannot\n  use fewer than 18 g. It is possible to form three kits: two with an 11 g\n  package, and one with an 18 g package.\nIn sample case #6, you can form three valid kits: (700 g, 800 g, 900 g),\n  which makes 10 servings, and (1500 g, 1600 g, 1700 g) and (1260 g, 1440 g,\n  1620 g), each of which makes 20 servings. Note that you could also say that\n  the (1260 g, 1440 g, 1620 g) kit makes 17, 18, or 19 servings, but it does\n  not matter how many servings a kit makes as long as the kit is valid.\n",

This system\n  servesNdifferent cities. In each city, there is one horse (as in the\n  expression \"one-horse town\"); each horse travels at a certain constant speed\n  and has a maximum total distance it can travel before it becomes too tired to\n  continue.\nThe Pony Express rider starts off on the starting city's horse. Every time the\n  rider reaches a city, they may continue to use their current horse or switch\n  to that city's horse; switching is instantaneous. Horses never get a chance to\n  rest, so whenever part of a horse's maximum total distance is \"used up\", it is\n  used up forever! When the rider reaches the destination city, the mail is\n  delivered.\nThe routes between cities were established via complicated negotiations\n  between company owners, lawmakers, union delegates, and cousin Pete. That\n  means that the distances between cities do not necessarily follow common\n  sense: for instance, they do not necessarily comply with the triangle\n  inequality, and the distance from city A to city B might be different from the\n  distance from city B to city A!\nYou are a time traveling entrepreneur, and you have brought a fast computer\n  from the future. A single computer is not enough for you to set up an e-mail\n  service and make the Pony Express obsolete, but you can use it to make optimal\n  routing plans for the Pony Express. Given all data about routes between cities\n  and the horses in each city, and a list of pairs of starting and ending\n  cities, can you quickly calculate the minimum time necessary for each\n  delivery?

Both horses have enough endurance, so both options\n  are viable. Since the horse in city 2 is faster, it is better to change, for a\n  total time of 1/3 + 1/4.\nIn Case #2 there are two intermediate cities in which you can change\n  horses. If you change horses in city 2, however, your new horse, while\n  blazingly fast, will not have enough endurance, so you will be forced to\n  change again in city 3. If you keep your horse, you will have the option to\n  change horses (or not) in city 3. So, the three options, with their total\n  times, are:\nIn Case #3, there are lots of alternatives for each delivery. The optimal one\n  for the first delivery (city 2 to city 4) is to go to city 1 in time 10/1000,\n  change horses, and then go to cities 2, 3 and 4, in that order, using the\n  horse from city 1, which takes time (10 + 10 + 10) / 60.\nFor the second delivery (city 3 to city 2) you have no choice but to first go\n  to city 4 which takes time 10/5. Your relatively fast horse does not have\n  enough endurance to get anywhere else, so you need to grab the horse in city\n  4. You could use it to get directly to city 1 in time 15, but that would be\n  slower than riding it to city 2 in time 6 and then using the blazingly fast\n  horse in city 2 to get to city 1 in just 10/1000 extra time.\nIn the third delivery (city 3 to city 1) of Case #3 it is optimal to use the\n  first two steps of the previous one, for a total time of 10/5 + 6 = 8.\n",

To make the AI as creative as possible, we have given itNdifferent \"cores\", each of which has its own \"personality\". However, just\n  like people, these cores may become distracted or corrupt or may refuse to\n  work; the i-th core has asuccess probabilityPiof\n  functioning properly. As long as at leastKof the cores function\n  properly, the AI will function properly. Otherwise, it will probably become\n  evil and trap us in a maze of fiendish puzzles of its own design. And who\n  knows what it might do to Code Jam — it might just write a bunch of\n  tough probability problems!\nTo prevent this from happening, we plan to train one or more of the cores to\n  become more reliable. We have a total ofU\"training units\" that we\n  can use to improve the cores. Spending X units on the i-th core will\n  add X to its success probability. We can divide up the units among the\n  cores however we like, and it is possible that one or more cores may not\n  receive any units. Of course, a core's success probability cannot be\n  increased above 1.\nIf we assign the training units to maximize the probability that the AI will\n  function properly, what is that probability?\nThis problem has 2 Small datasets and no Large dataset. You must solve the\n  first Small dataset before you can attempt the second Small dataset. You will\n  be able to retry either of the datasets (with a time penalty).\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow; each consists of three lines. The first line\n  contains two integersNandK: the total number of cores, and\n  the minimum number of cores that must succeed for the AI to function\n  properly. The second line contains one rationalU: the number of\n  training units. The third line containsNrational numbersPi; the i-th of these gives the probability that the i-th\n  core will function properly. All of these probabilities are specified to\n  exactly four decimal places of precision.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the probability that the AI will function properly if the training units\n  are assigned optimally.ywill be considered correct if it is\n  within an absolute or relative error of 10-6of the correct\n  answer.

Then the\n  probability that the AI functions properly is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25. Any\n  other assignment is inferior; for instance, if we train one core to 0.9 and\n  the other core to 0.1, the probability of success is only 0.9 × 0.1 =\n  0.09.\nIn Sample Case #3, we have no training units to spend, and at least one of\n  the two cores must function properly for the AI to function properly. We can\n  approach this by first calculating the probability that the AI doesnotfunction properly, which happens only if both cores fail to\n  function properly. The probability that both cores fail is (1 - 0.9) ×\n  (1 - 0.8) = 0.02. So the probability that at least one core functions\n  properly, and thus that the AI functions properly, is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\nIn Sample Case #4, the optimal strategy is to give all the training units to\n  the second core. That makes the probability of at least one core functioning\n  properly 1 - (0.4 × 0.6) = 0.76. All other options are inferior; for\n  example, giving all the training units to the first core only yields 0.75,\n  and dividing them equally among the cores gives 0.7525.\n",

Cameron hasACof these and Jamie hasAJ. These activities always take place at the same times\n  each day. None of Cameron's activities overlap with Jamie's activities, so at\n  least one of the parents will always be free to take care of the baby.\nCameron and Jamie want to come up with a daily baby care schedule such that:\nFor example, suppose that Jamie and Cameron have a single activity each:\n  Jamie has a morning activity from 9 am to 10 am, and Cameron has an afternoon\n  activity from 2 pm to 3 pm. One possible but suboptimal schedule would be for\n  Jamie to take care of the baby from midnight to 6 am and from noon to 6 pm,\n  and for Cameron to take care of the baby from 6 am to noon and 6 pm to\n  midnight. That fulfills the first two conditions, and requires a total of 4\n  exchanges, which happen at midnight, 6 am, noon and 6 pm.

The chocolate to be given away comes in packs ofPpieces. You would like to open new packs for each tour group, but\n  the owner insists that if there are leftover pieces from one group, they must\n  be used with the next tour group before opening up any new packs.\nFor instance, suppose that each pack containsP=3 pieces, and that a\n  tour group with 5 people comes. You will open two packs to give one piece to\n  each person, and you will have one piece left over. Suppose that after that,\n  another tour group with 6 people comes.

You would\n  prefer to promote as few tickets as possible, since too many promotions\n  might cause customers to get greedy and ask for more promotions in the\n  future.\nGiven the positions and buyers of all the tickets that have been sold, what\n  is the minimum number of rides needed to honor all tickets, using as many\n  promotions as needed and scheduling the rides optimally? And what is the\n  minimum number of ticket promotions necessary to attain that number of rides?\n  Note that promoting a given customer on a given ride from seat 4 to seat 2,\n  for example, counts as only one promotion, not two separate ones.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each test case starts with a single line with\n  three integersN, the number of seats in the roller coaster,C,\n  the number of potential customers, andM, the number of tickets sold.\n  The customers are identified with numbers between 1 andC. Then,Mlines follow, each containing two integers:Pi,\n  the position in the roller coaster assigned to the i-th ticket, andBi, the identifier of the buyer of that ticket.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y z,\n  wherexis the test case number (starting from 1),yis the minimum number of rides you need to honor all tickets\n  if you use the promotions and schedule the rides optimally, andzis the minimum number of promotions you need to make be able\n  to honor all tickets withyrides.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.2 ≤N≤ 1000.1 ≤M≤ 1000.1 ≤Pi≤N.1 ≤Bi≤C.\nC= 2.\n2 ≤C≤ 1000.\nNote that the last two sample cases would not appear in the Small dataset.\nIn Case #1, both customers purchased a ticket for position 2. It is\n  impossible to honor both tickets with a single ride, but promoting either\n  ticket to position 1 allows you to accommodate both tickets on the same\n  round.\nCase #2 is a similar story, except both tickets are for position 1. Since you\n  cannot promote those tickets or exchange them for inferior tickets, you are\n  forced to run 2 separate rides, one per customer.\nCase #3 features the same customer purchasing both positions. Since you are\n  forced to have 2 rides for that customer, there is no reason to give out any\n  promotions.\nIn Case #4, notice that there may be both customers and positions with no\n  tickets assigned. In this case, there are three tickets sold for position\n  three. If you promote customer 2 to position 2, for instance, you can have\n  one ride with customer 1 sitting in position 2 and customer 3 sitting in\n  position 3, and a second ride with customer 2 in position 2 and customer 1 in\n  position 3. Additional promotions will not allow you to decrease the number\n  of rides, because customer 1 has two tickets and you need to honor those in\n  different rides, regardless of position.\nIn Case #5, one optimal solution is to promote one of the3 1tickets to1 1.\n",

People are\n  happy that love and peace have returned.\nThe city is represented as a grid withRrows andCcolumns.\n  Some cells on the grid are buildings (through which nobody can see, nobody can\n  shoot, and nobody can walk), and some are streets (through which everybody can\n  see, shoot and walk). Unfortunately, during the war, the now-defeated\n  invaders set up automatic security turrets in the city. These turrets are only\n  in streets (not in buildings). They pose a threat to the citizens, but\n  fortunately, there are also some soldiers on the streets (not in buildings).\n  Initially, no soldier is in the same place as a turret.\nThe invader turrets do not move. They are small, so they don't block sight and\n  shooting. A soldier cannot walk through an active turret's cell, but can walk\n  through it once it is destroyed. A turret can only see soldiers in the cells\n  for which it has a horizontal or vertical line of sight. If a soldier enters\n  such a cell, the turret does not fire. If a soldier attempts to exit such a\n  cell (after entering it, or after starting in that cell),\n  the turret fires. Luckily, a soldier can still shoot from that cell,\n  and the turret will not detect that as movement. It means that none of your\n  soldiers will actually die, because in the worst case they can always wait,\n  motionless, for help (perhaps for a long time). Maybe you will have a chance\n  to rescue them later.\nEach soldier can make a total ofMunit moves. Each of these moves must\n  be one cell in a horizontal or vertical direction. Soldiers can walk through\n  each other and do not block the lines of sight of other soldiers or turrets.\n  Each soldier also has one bullet. If a soldier has a turret in her horizontal or vertical line\n  of sight, the soldier can shoot and destroy it. Each shot can only destroy one\n  turret, but the soldiers are such excellent shooters that they can even shoot\n  past one or several turrets or soldiers in their line of sight and hit another turret\n  farther away!\nYou are given a map (with the soldier and turret positions marked).

If multiple valid\n  strategies exist, you may output any one of them.\nSoldiers are numbered from 1, reading from left to right along the top row,\n  then left to right along the next row down from the top, and so on, from top\n  to bottom.\nTurrets use their own independent numbers, and are numbered starting from 1,\n  in the same way.\nMemory limit: 1 GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.0 ≤M<C×R.\nTime limit: 30 seconds.1 ≤C≤ 30.1 ≤R≤ 30.The number ofSsymbols is between 1 and 10.The number ofTsymbols is between 1 and 10.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.1 ≤C≤ 100.1 ≤R≤ 100.The number ofSsymbols is between 1 and 100.The number ofTsymbols is between 1 and 100.\nIn Case #2, one of the possible solutions is to move soldier 3 up three\n  cells and shoot turret 3.

Then soldier 2 can move up one cell, then right three cells\n  and shoot turret 1. Finally, soldier 6 can move down one cell, then right\n  three cells and shoot turret 3.

A\n  googlement is a substance that can be represented by a string of at most\n  nine digits.

For example,103and001are valid googlements of length 3.400(which contains a digit, 4, greater than the length of the googlement, 3) and000(which contains no digit greater than 0) are not.\nAny valid googlement can appear in the world at any time, but it will\n  eventually decay into another googlement in a deterministic way, as follows.\n  For a googlement of length L, count the number of1s in the\n  googlement (which could be 0) and write down that value, then count the\n  number of2s in the googlement (which could be 0) and write down\n  that value to the right of the previous value, and so on, until you finally\n  count and write down the number of Ls. The new string generated in this way\n  represents the new googlement, and it will also have length L.

On one of her recent trips, she traveled\n  from San Francisco to Frankfurt to Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi to Singapore to\n  Tokyo and back to San Francisco. On this trip, she circumnavigated the Earth\n  by traveling along a closed path that touches every meridian. In other words,\n  for every possible longitude, there is at least one point along this path at\n  that longitude.\nK is not sure that this trip qualifies as beingsuper awesome, however,\n  since it would also be possible to circumnavigate the Earth by flying to the\n  North Pole and then walking around it, which does not seem to be particularly\n  difficult (other than the part about flying to the North Pole). So she has\n  decided to come up with a more generalized definition of circumnavigation.\n  The new concept is calledomnicircumnavigation— a closed path\n  around the Earth (which we assume to be a sphere) that is a circumnavigation\n  regardless of where one places the poles. In other words, an\n  omnicircumnavigation is a closed path on the surface of a sphere that touches\n  every possible hemisphere. (Touching the edge of a hemisphere is sufficient.)\n  Equivalently, an omnicircumnavigation intersects every possible great circle\n  — a circle of greatest possible diameter on the surface of a sphere.\nYou are given a sequence ofNpoints on a sphere of radius 1. You need\n  to check whether a path connecting those points in order is an\n  omnicircumnavigation. The path is formed by connecting each pair of\n  successive points along the shortest possible surface route, and connecting\n  the last point to the first one in the same way. No two successive points\n  (including the pair of the last point and the first point) are collinear with\n  the origin. (That is, they are not antipodes — polar opposites —\n  and they do not represent the same point on the surface of the sphere.)\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

There are many hemispheres\n  that do not overlap that path at all.\nIn Sample Case #2, the eight points are the corners of a cube inscribed in\n  the sphere; any hemisphere will contain at least some parts of that path.\n  Note that dividing all values by 5 would produce an equivalent case (with the\n  same set of points).\nIn Sample Case #3, the path is itself a great circle, and so every other\n  great circle must intersect it somewhere.\nSample Case #4 uses the same three points as in Sample Case #3, except that\n  the first two points are visited twice each.

For\n  example, a card might say+ 0, or- -2, or/ -4— note that operands can be negative or zero,\n  although a card with a division operation will never have 0 as an operand.\nIn each round of the game, a starting integer valueSis chosen, and\n  a set ofCcards is laid out. The player must\n  choose an order for the cards, using each card exactly once. After that, the\n  operations are applied, in order, to the starting valueS, and a final\n  result is obtained.\nAlthough all of the operands on the cards are integers, the operations are\n  executed on rational numbers. For instance, suppose that the initial value\n  is 5, and the cards are+ 1,- 2,* 3,\n  and/ -2. If we put them in the order given above, the final\n  result is (5 + 1 - 2) * 3 / (-2) = -6. Notice that the operations are\n  performed in the order given by the cards, disregarding any operator\n  precedence. On the other hand, if we choose the order- 2,/ -2,+ 1,* 3, the result is\n  ((5 - 2) / (-2) + 1) * 3 = -3 / 2.

        "problem_statement": "This problem is a well-known classic; we present it primarily as an opportunity\n  for you to try out the interactive judging system.\nWe are thinking of an integer P within the range (A,B] —\n  that is,A< P ≤B. You haveNtries to guess our\n  number. After each guess that is not correct, we will tell you whether P is\n  higher or lower than your guess.\nThis problem isinteractive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different\n  than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process\n  that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses.\n  All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output.\n  Remember that many programming languages buffer the output by default, so\n  make sure your output actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the\n  buffer) before blocking to wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer.\n  Anything your program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might\n  consume some memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not\n  overflow it. To help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is\n  provided at the very end of the problem statement.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will read a single line with two integersAandB, representing the exclusive lower bound and inclusive\n  upper bound, as described above. In the next line, you will read a single\n  integerN, representing the maximum number of guesses you can make.\n  Your program will process up toNexchanges with our judge.\nFor each exchange, your program needs to use standard output to send a single\n  line with one integer Q: your guess. In response to your guess, the judge\n  will print a single line with one word to your input stream, which your\n  program must read through standard input. The word will beCORRECTif your guess is correct,TOO_SMALLif your\n  guess is less than the correct answer, andTOO_BIGif your guess\n  is greater than the correct answer. Then, you can start another exchange.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g., wrong output format, or\n  out-of-bounds values), the judge will sendWRONG_ANSWERto your input\n  stream and it will not send any other output after that. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after receivingWRONG_ANSWER,\n  your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice\n  that it is your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive\n  the appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\nIf your test case is solved withinNtries, you will receive theCORRECTmessage from the judge, as mentioned above, and then\n  continue to get input (a new line with two integersAandB,\n  etc.) for the next test case. AfterNtries, if the test case is not\n  solved, the judge will printWRONG_ANSWERand then stop sending output\n  to your input stream.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all test\n  cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output after\n  receivingCORRECTfor the last test case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\n1 ≤T≤ 20.A= 0.N= 30.Time limit: 10 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.\nB= 30.\nB= 109.\nHere is a piece of pseudocode that demonstrates an interaction for one test set.\n  Suppose there are three test cases in this test set. The pseudocode first reads an\n  integer t, representing the number of test cases. Then the first test case begins.\n  Suppose the correct answer P is 9 for the first test case. The pseudocode first\n  reads three integers a, b, and n, representing the guessing range and maximum\n  number of tries, respectively, and then outputs a guess 30. Since 30 is greater\n  than 9, the stringTOO_BIGis received through stdin from the judge.\n  Then the pseudocode guesses 5 and receivesTOO_SMALLin response.\n  The guess 10 is subsequently printed to stdout which is again too big. Finally\n  the pseudocode guesses 9, and receivesCORRECTbecause 9 is the\n  correct answer.\nThe second test case shows what happens if the code continues to read from stdin\n  after the judge stops sending info. In this example, the contestant guesses 31,\n  which is outside the range (0, 30]. As a result, the judging system sendsWRONG_ANSWERto the input stream of the pseudocode and stops sending anything after that.\n  However, after readingWRONG_ANSWERinto string s, the code continues to read for\n  the next test case. Since there is nothing in the input stream (judge has stopped\n  sending info), the code hangs and will eventually receive a Time Limit Exceeded Error.\nIf the code in the example above exits immediately after readingWRONG_ANSWER,\n  it will receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test\n  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can\n  use ourinteractive runnerfor that.

We plan\n  to use this orchard to grow a variety of trees — AVL, binary, red-black,\n  splay, and so on — so we need topreparesome of the cells by\n  digging holes:\nNote that the above also implies that none of the cells outside of that\n  rectangle can be prepared. We want the orchard to look tidy!\nFor example, whenA=11, although the eleven prepared cells in the left\n  figure below form a 3x4 rectangle (that is, with 3 rows and 4 columns), the\n  cell in the center of the rectangle is not prepared. As a result, we have not\n  yet completed preparing our orchard, since not every cell of the 3x4 rectangle\n  is prepared. However, after just preparing the center cell, the rectangle of\n  size at least 11 is fully filled, and the orchard is ready.\nSee below for another example. In this case,A=6. Note that the middle\n  figure prepares a cell outside the 3x2 rectangle, so although the rightmost\n  figure prepares a rectangle of size 6, the entire set of the prepared cells\n  does not form a rectangle (due to the extra cell on the left). As a result,\n  the orchard is not ready.\nDigging is hard work for humans, so we have borrowed theGo gopherfrom theGoogle Goteam and trained it to help us\n  out by preparing cells. We candeploythe gopher by giving it the\n  coordinates of atarget cellin the matrix that is not along any of\n  the borders of the matrix. However, we have not yet perfected the gopher's\n  training, so it will choose a cell uniformly at(pseudo-)randomfrom the 3x3 block of nine cells centered on the target\n  cell, and then prepare the cell it has chosen. (If it chooses a cell that\n  was already prepared, it will uselessly prepare it again.)\nWe can only deploy the gopher up to 1000 times before it gets too tired to\n  keep digging, so we need your help in figuring out how to deploy it\n  strategically. When you deploy the gopher, you will be told which cell the\n  gopher actually prepared, and you can take this information into account\n  before deploying it again, if needed. Note that you do not have to declare\n  the dimensions or location of a rectangle in advance.\nThis problem isinteractive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different\n  than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process\n  that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses.\n  All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output.\n  Remember that many programming languages buffer the output by default, so\n  make sure your output actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the\n  buffer) before blocking to wait for a response.

To help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is\n  provided at the very end of the problem statement. In addition, sample solutions\n  to a previous Code Jam interactive problem (in all of our supported languages) are\n  provided in the analysis forNumber Guessing.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will read a single line containing a single\n  integerAindicating the minimum required prepared rectangular area.\n  Then, your program will process up to 1000 exchanges with our judge.\nFor each exchange, your program needs to use standard output to send a single\n  line containing two integers I and J: the row and column number you want to\n  deploy the gopher to. The two integers must be between 2 and 999, and written\n  in base-10 without leading zeroes. If your output format is wrong (e.g., out\n  of bounds values), your program will fail, and the judge will send you a single\n  line with-1 -1which signals that\n  your test has failed, and it will not send anything to your input stream after\n  that. Otherwise, in response to your deployment, the judge will print a single\n  line containing two integers I' and J' to your input stream, which your\n  program must read through standard input.\nIf the last deployment caused the set of prepared cells to be a rectangle\n  of area at leastA, you will get I' = J' = 0, signaling the end of the\n  test case. Otherwise, I' and J' are the row and column numbers of the cell\n  that was actually prepared by the gopher, with abs(I'-I) ≤ 1 and abs(J'-J) ≤ 1.\n  Then, you can start another exchange.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g. wrong output format, or\n  out-of-bounds values), as mentioned above, the judge will send I' = J' = -1,\n  and stop sending output to your input stream afterwards. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after reading in I' = J' = -1, your program\n  will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is\n  your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive the\n  appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\nIf the test case is solved within 1000 deployments, you will receive the\n  I' = J' = 0 message from the judge, as mentioned above, and then continue to\n  solve the next test case. After 1000 exchanges, if the test case is not\n  solved, the judge will send the I' = J' = -1 message, and stop sending output\n  to your input stream after.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all test\n  cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output after\n  receiving I' = J' = 0 message from the judge for the last test case, you will\n  receive a Wrong Answer judgment.\nPlease be advised that for a given test case, the cells that the gopher will pick\n  from each 3x3 block are (pseudo-)random and independent of each other, but\n  they are determined using the same seed each time for the same test case,\n  so a solution that gives an incorrect result for a test case will do so\n  consistently across all attempts for the same test case. We have also set\n  different seeds for different test cases.\n1 ≤T≤ 20.Memory limit: 1 GB.\nA= 20.Time limit (for the entire test set): 20 seconds.\nA= 200.Time limit (for the entire test set): 60 seconds.\nThe pseudocode above is the first half of a sample interaction for one test set.\n  Suppose there are only two test cases in this test set. The pseudocode first reads\n  the number of test cases into an integert. Then the first test case begins.\n  For the first test case, supposeAis 3 (although, in the real test sets,Ais always either 20 or 200). The pseudocode first reads the value ofAinto an integera, and outputs10 10the location of\n  the cell to prepare. By (pseudo-)random choice, the cell at location 10 11 is\n  prepared, so the code reads10 11in response. Next, the code\n  outputs cell10 10again for preparation, and the gopher prepares10 10this time. The code subsequently sends10 12with\n  the goal of finishing preparing a rectangle of size 3, but only gets cell10 11prepared again.10 10is then sent out, and this time11 10is prepared. Notice that although the prepared area is of size 3,\n  a rectangle has not been formed, so the preparation goes on. In the end, the pseudocode\n  decides to try out cell11 10, and0 0is sent back, which\n  implies that cell 11 11 has been prepared, completing a rectangle (or square, rather)\n  or size 4. As a result, the first test case is successfully solved.\nNow the pseudocode is ready for the second test case. It again first reads an integera = 3and decides to send cell10 10to prepare.\n  However, this time, the code forgets to\n    flush the stdout buffer! As a result, 10 10 is buffered and not sent to the judge.\n  Both the judge and the code wait on each other, leading to a deadlock and eventually a\n  Time Limit Exceeded error.\nThe code above is another example. Suppose for the second test case, the code\n  remembers to flush the output buffer, but sends out cell1 1to prepare.\n  Remember that the row and column of the chosen cell must both be in the range\n  [2, 999], so 1 1 is illegal! As a result, the judge sends back-1 -1.\n  However, after reading-1 -1into x and y, the code proceeds to\n  send another cell location to the judge, and wait. Since there is nothing in\n  the input stream (the judge has stopped sending info), the code hangs and will\n  eventually receive a Time Limit Exceeded error.\nNote that if the code in the example above exits immediately after reading-1 -1, it will receive a Wrong Answer instead:\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

We have to stop it!\nFortunately, we understand how the robot works. It starts off with a beam\n  with a strength of 1, and it will run a program that is a series of\n  instructions, which will be executed one at a time, in left to right order.\n  Each instruction is of one of the following two types:\nFor example, if the robot's program isSCCSSC, the robot will\n  do the following when the program runs:\nIn that case, the program would do a total of 9 damage.\nThe universe's top algorithmists have developed a shield that can withstand\n  a maximum total ofDdamage. But the robot's current program might do\n  more damage than that when it runs.\nThe President of the Universe has volunteered to fly into space to hack the\n  robot's program before the robot runs it. The only way the President can hack\n  (without the robot noticing) is by swapping two adjacent instructions. For\n  example, the President could hack the above program once by swapping the\n  third and fourth instructions to make itSCSCSC. This would\n  reduce the total damage to 7. Then, for example, the president could hack the\n  program again to make itSCSSCC, reducing the damage to 5, and\n  so on.\nTo prevent the robot from getting too suspicious, the President does not\n  want to hack too many times. What is this smallest possible number of hacks\n  which will ensure that the program does no more thanDtotal damage,\n  if it is possible to do so?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each consists of one line containing an integerDand a stringP: the maximum total damage our shield can\n  withstand, and the robot's program.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y,\n  wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis either the minimum number of hacks needed to accomplish\n  the goal, orIMPOSSIBLEif it is not possible.\n1 ≤T≤ 100.1 ≤D≤ 109.2 ≤ length ofP≤ 30.Every character inPis eitherCorS.Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.\nThe robot's program contains either zero or oneCcharacters.\nNo additional restrictions to the Limits section.\nNote that the last three sample cases would not appear in test set 1.\nIn Sample Case #1, the President can swap the two instructions to reduce the\n  total damage to 1, which the shield can withstand.\nIn Sample Case #2, the President does not need to hack the program at all,\n  since the shield can already withstand the 2 total damage it will cause.\nIn Sample Case #3, the program will do more damage than the shield can\n  withstand, and hacking will do nothing to change this. The universe is doomed.\nSample Case #4 uses the program described in the problem statement. The\n  statement demonstrates one way to reduce the total damage to 5 using two\n  hacks. It is not possible to reduce the damage to 6 or less by using only one\n  hack; remember that the President can only swap adjacent instructions.\nIn Sample Case #5, the robot will never shoot, and so it will never do any\n  damage. No hacking is required.\nIn Sample Case #6, five hacks are required. Notice that even if two hacks\n  swap the instructions at the same two positions, they still count as separate\n  hacks.\n",

        "problem_statement": "Deep in Code Jam's secret algorithm labs, we devote countless hours to\n  wrestling with one of the most complex problems of our time: efficiently\n  sorting a list of integers into non-decreasing order. We have taken a careful\n  look at the classicbubble sortalgorithm, and we are pleased to announce a new variant.\nThe basic operation of the standard bubble sort algorithm is to examine a\n  pair of adjacent numbers, and reverse that pair if the left number is\n  larger than the right number. But our algorithm examines a group ofthreeadjacent numbers, and if the leftmost number is larger than the\n  rightmost number, it reverses that entire group. Because our algorithm is a\n  \"triplet bubble sort\", we have named it Trouble Sort for short.\nFor example, for L = 5 6 6 4 3, Trouble Sort would proceed as follows:\nWe were looking forward to presenting Trouble Sort at the Special Interest\n  Group in Sorting conference in Hawaii, but one of our interns has just\n  pointed out a problem: it is possible that Trouble Sort does not correctly\n  sort the list! Consider the list 8 9 7, for example.\nWe need your help with some further research. Given a list ofNintegers, determine whether Trouble Sort will successfully sort the list into\n  non-decreasing order. If it will not, find the index (counting starting from\n  0) of the first sorting error after the algorithm has finished: that is, the\n  first value that is larger than the value that comes directly after it when\n  the algorithm is done.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines: one line\n  with an integerN, the number of values in the list, and then another\n  line withNintegersVi, the list of values.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyisOKif Trouble Sort correctly sorts the list, or the index\n  (counting starting from 0) of the first sorting error, as described above.\n1 ≤T≤ 100.0 ≤Vi≤ 109, for all i.Memory limit: 1GB.\n3 ≤N≤ 100.Time limit (for the entire test set): 10 seconds.\n3 ≤N≤ 105.Time limit (for the entire test set): 20 seconds.\nNotice that test set 2 for this problem has a large amount of input, so\n  using a non-buffered reader might lead to slower input reading. In addition,\n  keep in mind that certain languages have a small input buffer size by default.\nSample Case #1 is similar to the first one described in the problem\n  statement. Trouble Sort correctly sorts this list, so the answer isOK.\nSample Case #2 is the second one described in the problem statement. Trouble\n  Sort does not correctly sort this list, since it terminates with the list\n  7 9 8. The 9 is the first value in the list that is larger than\n  the next value, so the index of the first sorting error is 1.\n",

We just\n  deployedRrobot shoppers to our local supermarket to buy party\n  supplies for our World Finals in Toronto, but their first-order model of a\n  Canadian party was very simple: they just boughtB\"bits\" (a bit being\n  a small donut-like treat found in the area). We will work on improving their\n  AI later, but for now, we want to help them purchase all of those bits as\n  quickly as possible.\nThe supermarket hasCcashiers who can scan customers' purchases. The\n  i-th cashier will:\nThat is, a customer who brings N bits to the i-th cashier (where N must be\n  less than or equal toMi) will spend a total ofSi× N +Piseconds interacting\n  with that cashier.\nBefore the robots interact with any cashiers, you will distribute the bits\n  among the robots however you want. (Bits must remain intact; you cannot\n  break them up into fractional pieces!) Any robot that gets no bits will not\n  get to interact with a cashier, and will go away disappointed.\nThen, for each robot with at least one bit, you will choose adifferentsingle cashier. (Two robots cannot use the same cashier, and\n  a robot cannot use more than one cashier.) The robots all start interacting\n  with their cashiers at time 0. Note that once a robot finishes interacting\n  with its cashier, it cannot be given more bits and cannot interact with other\n  cashiers.\nIf you help the robots make optimal choices, what is the earliest time at\n  which all of the robots can finish interacting with their cashiers?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

So, you must give one bit to each\n  robot. Cashier 1 takes 5 seconds, and Cashier 2 takes 3 seconds, so the time\n  required is 5 seconds.\nSample Case #2 is similar to the previous case, except that now Cashier 2\n  can handle up to 2 items. So, it is best to give all the bits to one robot\n  and have that robot use Cashier 2. This takes 1 second per item plus 2\n  seconds = 4 seconds.\nIn Sample Case #3, the optimal strategy is to send one robot with 2 bits to\n  cashier 2, and two robots with 1 bit each to any of the other cashiers.\n",

Along that road, there is a sequence ofSmysterious road signs with numbers on both sides. The i-th sign (numbered in\n  order from west to east) is at a pointDikilometers east\n  of Signfield, and has a numberAion the west-facing side\n  and a numberBion the east-facing side.\nNobody in Signfield knows what these signs are trying to say. You think\n  that the numbers on the west sides of the signs are intended for drivers\n  traveling east, and that they represent distances to some particular\n  destination. Similarly, you think that the numbers on the east sides of the\n  signs are for drivers traveling west, and that they represent distances to\n  some particular destination. You suspect that not all of the signs may be\n  consistent with this theory, though.\nTo start testing your theory, you are interested in finding valid sets of\n  signs that obey the following rules:\nWhat is the largest possible number of signs in a valid set as described\n  above, and how many different valid sets of that size are there?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

That is the only set\n  of that length, so the answer is1 1.\nIn Sample Case #2, note that the first, second, fourth, and fifth signs would\n  be consistent with M = 9 and N = -1, but they do not form a contiguous\n  subsequence. (The 1 on the back of the third sign cannot be used as if it\n  were on the front.) As it turns out, there is no valid set of four signs.\n  There are two different valid sets of three signs.

At the start of the day, you makeNlollipops, each of a single unique flavor, like huckleberry, cherry or lime.Ncustomers come into the shop during the day, one at a time. Each\n  customer gives you a list of which of your lollipop flavors they like. You\n  can sell them one lollipop of any of those flavors, as long as you have not\n  already sold someone else the same flavor earlier in the day (since there is\n  only one lollipop of each flavor). If none of the flavors they like are still\n  available, you cannot sell them a lollipop, and they leave your shop\n  disappointed.\nYou do not know what each customer's flavor preferences are going to be until\n  they arrive. Each customer decides if they like or dislike each flavor\n  randomly, independently of whether they like any other flavor, or what\n  flavors anyone else likes. However, your market studies have shown that some\n  flavors may have a higher probability of being liked in general! For example,\n  the lime flavor might have a 10% chance of being liked by any particular\n  customer, whereas that chance might be 1% for the cherry flavor. These values\n  are always chosen independently and uniformly at random from the interval\n  [0.005, 0.1].\nObviously, you want to sell lollipops to as many of theNcustomers\n  as possible! But, since you do not know what flavors your customers will ask\n  for ahead of time, you cannot always make an optimal decision —\n  sometimes you might sell a customer one flavor, and then later wish you had\n  sold them another.\nSuppose that you somehow knew all the customers' preferences in advance and\n  could plan ahead; then there is some maximum number M of lollipops that you\n  could possibly sell. You do not know the customers' preferences in advance,\n  but we require you to sell a number of lollipops that is at least 90% of M\n  foreachinput case.\nThis problem isinteractive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different\n  than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process\n  that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses.\n  All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output.\n  Remember that many programming languages buffer the output by default, so\n  make sure your output actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the\n  buffer) before blocking to wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer.\n  Anything your program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might\n  consume some memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not\n  overflow it.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program should read a single line with one integerN, the number of lollipops (which is the same as the number of\n  customers).\nThen, for each of the customers, your program should read a single line,\n  which will contain space-separated integers. The first integer isD,\n  the number of flavors that customer likes. Then,Dintegers follow,\n  the ID numbers of those flavors, in strictly increasing order. Flavors have\n  unique ID numbers in the range [0,N- 1]. Note thatDmight be\n  zero for some or all customers.\nAfter each of these lines, your program must write a single line to standard\n  output, containing the ID number of one of theDflavors to sell to the\n  customer, or-1if no lollipop is to be sold to the customer.\n  After you have written theNth line for the test case,\n  your program should terminate if it was the last test case; otherwise, it\n  should start reading data for the next test case.\nIf your program gets something wrong (e.g., tries to sell a customer a flavor\n  that was already sold, or tries to sell a customer a flavor they don't like,\n  or uses the wrong output format, or outputs an out-of-bounds value), the\n  judge will send-1to your input\n  stream and it will not send any other output after that. If your program\n  continues to wait for the judge after receiving-1,\n  your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice\n  that it is your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive\n  the appropriate verdict (Wrong Answer, Runtime Error, etc.) instead of a Time\n  Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total time or memory is exceeded, or\n  your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate verdict.\n  Not selling enough lollipops for a test case will not cause you to get the-1message.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after processing all\n  test cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output\n  after the last test case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\nAt the start of each test case, the judge will determine all customers'\n  preferences. That is, it will use a (hidden) list of probabilities\n  Pibetween 0.005 and 0.1, one for each flavor; each customer has\n  a probability Piof liking the i-th flavor. That is, the random\n  variables indicating whether customer j likes flavor i are independent and\n  identically distributed. These preferences are constant throughout the test\n  and will not be modified e.g. in response to your choices.\nT= 50.N= 200.0 ≤D≤N.Time limit (for the entire test set): 25 seconds.Memory limit: 1GB.\nNote that this sample interaction has smaller values ofTandNthan the real data.

If two or more dancers share a row or\n  column and also have costumes of the same color and material, they will no\n  longer feel special.\nSupervin wants all of his dancers to feel special.

Construction is\n  done using a special fence-shooting 3D printer. There is only one such\n  device, so fences are built one at a time. The printer is small enough that\n  you can consider it a single point on the plane.\nTo build a fence f, you must first position the printer at a point p in the\n  plane such that the printer can see all of f without being obstructed by\n  previously constructed fences.

You can choose any position for the printer to be at before the\n  first fence is built and after the last fence is built.\nHaving to follow this procedure means that you cannot necessarily build the\n  fences in any order. For example, you might choose an order that blocks off\n  the printer and prevents you from moving it to where it needs to be.\nThe director of the organization has drafted a relative ordering involvingKof the fences (but none of these have been built yet) without giving\n  much thought to it.\n  To avoid angering them, you need to use this ordering, inserting\n  the remainingF-Kfences anywhere you like to complete the\n  ordering.\nGiven these restrictions, find an order in which to build the fences.

        "problem_statement": "A research consortium is building a new datacenter. In the datacenter,\n  a set of computers is set up to work together and communicate via a network.\n  The network works only with direct bidirectional links between computers.\n  A pair of computers c1and c2that are not connected\n  by a direct link can still communicate with each other, as long as there is\n  at least one path of links l1, l2, ..., lksuch that links liand li+1share an endpoint,\n  c1is an endpoint of l1, and c2is an\n  endpoint of lk. Any two computers can have at most one direct link between\n  them.\nThe consortium has asked you to submit a design that illustrates how many\n  computers will be in the network and how they will be connected to each other.\n  Each network design you submit must comply with a specific set of\n  restrictions:\nTo elaborate on the last point: each of the N computers in a network design\n  is initially assigned a unique integer between 1 and N that identifies it.\n  However, it is possible that after some downtime, the system will boot up\n  and the indentifiers will be permuted — that is, each computer will\n  still have a unique integer between 1 and N, but not necessarily the original\n  one. The network must be able to recover the original identifying integers\n  without having access to any information other than the existing direct links.\nTo evaluate your network designs, the research consortium has set up an\n  automated program. The program will receive one of your network designs,\n  validate conditions 1-3 above, and then send back a copy of the network\n  design with the following changes:\nYou need to be able to determine exactly how the IDs were changed. Formally,\n  the automated program will create a secret random permutation f of the\n  integers 1 through N, and it will assign those numbers to computers in a\n  \"blank copy\" of the network with all of the previous links removed. Then, for\n  each link between computers i and j in your network design, it will add a\n  link between f(i) and f(j) to the copy. You then must recreateexactlythe f that the automated program created. If there exists a different f' that\n  yields the same result and you return f', the consortium will not accept your\n  network design, as in such a case, you cannot ensure that the recovered IDs\n  are the original ones.\nFor every N between 10 and 100, inclusive, there exists at least one network\n  of N computers that complies with all restrictions above and has the property\n  that applying two different permutations f and f' to it produces two\n  different sets of links.\nThis problem isinteractive,\n  which means that the concepts of input and output are different than in\n  standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process that\n  both provides you with information and evaluates your responses. All\n  information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you\n  need to communicate should be sent via standard output. Remember that many\n  programming languages buffer the output by default, so make sure your output\n  actually goes out (for instance, by flushing the buffer) before blocking to\n  wait for a response. See theFAQfor an explanation of what it means to flush the buffer. Anything your\n  program sends through standard error is ignored, but it might consume some\n  memory and be counted against your memory limit, so do not overflow it. To\n  help you debug, a local testing tool script (in Python) is provided at the\n  very end of the problem statement. In addition, sample solutions to a\n  previous Code Jam interactive problem (in all of our supported languages) are\n  provided in the analysis forNumber Guessing.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nFor each test case, your program will first read a single line containing two\n  integersLandUindicating the inclusive range of values for\n  the number of computers in your network design.\nThen, you need to create a network design with N computers and print 2N+1\n  lines representing that design. The first line must contain a single integer\n  N. The remaining 2N lines must contain two integers A and B each, each\n  representing a different link between computers A and B, where A != B. Notice\n  that if you list link A B, you may not list A B nor B A again.\nUpon reading your network design, the judge will first check the first three\n  conditions listed in the statement above. If any of those is not met, the\n  judge will send you a single line containing a single-1, and\n  then finish all communication and wait for your program to finish. If your\n  program does finish correctly and without violating other limits, it\n  will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\nIf all of the conditions are met, the judge will send you 2N+1 lines. The\n  first line will contain a single integer N (the same N you sent). Then, the\n  next 2N lines will contain two integers each, describing the links of the\n  copy of the network design, in the same format as you used. The copy is\n  generated as described above, with the permutation f chosen uniformly at\n  random from all possible permutations, independently of your network design.\nTo finish a test case, you need to send the judge a single line with N\n  integers X1, X2, ..., XN, representing that\n  the computer to which you assigned number i was assigned number Xiin the judge's copy, for all i.\nIf the list is not the list the judge generated, you will receive a Wrong\n  Answer verdict. If it was in the last test case, the judge will send no\n  additional communication. Otherwise, the judge will send a single line\n  containing a single -1, and then no additional communication. In both cases,\n  the judge will wait for your program to end, and assign the Wrong Answer\n  verdict only if it ended normally and without violating any resource limits.\nYou should not send additional information to the judge after solving all\n  test cases. In other words, if your program keeps printing to standard output\n  after printing the list of Xs for the last test case, you will receive a\n  Wrong Answer judgment.\nNotice that you are allowed to submit the same network design for different\n  test cases, as long as that design complies with all restrictions for both\n  cases. Additionally, the seed from random generation in the judge is fixed,\n  so sending the same set of original network designs in the same order will\n  get back the same set of copies.\n1 ≤T≤ 30.Time limit: 10 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.\nL= 10.U= 50.\n10 ≤L≤ 50.L=U.\nNote that this sample interaction uses a smaller value ofLthan the\n  real data, for ease of illustration. Also note that there is no network of\n  exactly 6 computers with the property that applying two different\n  permutations f and f' to it produces two different sets of links, so it would\n  be a bad idea to design a network of exactly 6 computers, even if the\n  problem's limits allowed it!\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test\n  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can\n  use ourinteractive runnerfor that. For more information, read the instructions in comments in that\n  file, and also check out theInteractive Problems sectionof the FAQ.\nInstructions for the testing tool are included in comments within the tool.\n  We encourage you to add your own test cases. Please be advised that although\n  the testing tool is intended to simulate the judging system, it isNOTthe real judging system and might behave differently.

In fact, they kept hosting larger and larger parties over the\n  years, so they needed to raise the roof of their ballroom to keep the noise\n  level tolerable.\nWe know that the roof of their ballroom was always supported by the tips of\n  exactly three columns; these columns were infinitely thin line segments that\n  originated on the floor and rose up perpendicular to the floor. Whenever the\n  society wanted to raise the roof, they would begin by removing the existing\n  roof. Then, they would build a new column in a location where there was not\n  already a column. Finally, they would rest a new roof on the tips of the new\n  column and the two most recently built of the previously existing columns.\n  For mystical reasons, no three column bases were ever collinear, and no four\n  column tips were ever coplanar.\nEach roof was a convex polygon that was part of the plane defined by the three tips that\n  supported it. For each column c built before the supporting ones, the\n  roof did not intersect c at any point and was large enough to cover the\n  space above c. The roof did not touch the floor. The different roofs did not necessarily\n  all have the same shape.\nOn an archeological dig, you found allNcolumns that the society ever\n  built, but no roof. You want to determine a possible order in which the\n  columns could have been built that is consistent with the rules above. A\n  possible order is an ordering of theNcolumns such that, for each\n  prefix of length at least 4 of the ordering, there is a roof (convex polygon)\n  that contains the tips of the last three columns in the prefix, and for each other\n  column in the prefix with a tip at (x, y, h) the roof contains a point (x, y, z)\n  with z > h.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

        "problem_statement": "Your game company just ordered a lot of square game boards with 64 blank unit\n  cells, intending to turn them into chessboards, but your boss has suddenly\n  declared that chess is out of fashion. To make the best use of all of these\n  boards, you have designed a new puzzle that usestiles.\nA tile is a contiguous set of unit cells, connected edge-to-edge, that can\n  fit inside a 3x3 square of unit cells. For example, the following are\n  examples of valid tiles (with each@denoting a piece of the\n  tile, and extra.characters for padding):\n... @@@ @@@ .@@... @@@ @.@ @.@.@. @@@ @.. @@@\nThe following would NOT be valid tiles:\n@@. @.@ .@@.... .@. @@@@.@@ @.@ .@@.\nWhen the solver of your new puzzle places a tile on the board, its unit cells\n  must exactly overlap some unit cells on the board that have not already been\n  covered by other tiles. A tile is still considered the same type of tile even\n  after being arbitrarily translated, rotated (by multiples of 90 degrees),\n  and/or reflected, and the solver is allowed to do any of those things to a\n  tile while placing it. For example, all of these are considered to be\n  the same tile (and other variants of that tile are possible):\n.@. ..@ @.. ... @@.@@. .@@ @@. .@@ .@@@.. .@. .@. @@. ...\nTo make your puzzle, you will color one or more of the cells on the board\n  red. The solver will solve the puzzle by placing tiles on the board such that\n  all red cells are covered up, but no other cell is covered up. To save on\n  manufacturing costs, the solver receives only one type of tile, but they are\n  given exactly enough copies of it to be able to cover all of the red cells.\nYour job is to decide which of the board's cells to color red. Unfortunately,\n  your boss is still deciding which of two particular tiles to use for the\n  game. You are tired of waiting, so you have decided to try to color a set of\n  cells such that the puzzle can be solved regardless of which of the tiles\n  ends up being used.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow; each consists of four lines. Each of the first\n  three lines has three characters, then a single space, then three more\n  characters. The fourth line is a blank line.\nWhen looking at an entire case, the space characters separate a 3x3 grid on\n  the left and a 3x3 grid on the right. Each grid represents a frame in which\n  one of the two tiles is displayed. In each grid, each character is either@, representing a cell that is part of the tile, or., representing a cell that is not part of the tile. Note that\n  these.cells have nothing to do with the puzzle or the board,\n  and are just padding to make the shape of the tile clear. It is guaranteed\n  that the two tiles are not the same, as described in the statement above.\nOutputFor each test case, output one line withCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1), andyisPOSSIBLEif there is a solution to the problem, andIMPOSSIBLEif there is not. Then, if there is a solution, output\n  eight more lines of seventeen characters each, forming two 8x8 grids with one\n  column of space characters in between.

One\n  common example of a pangram is \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".\n  Sometimes our pangrams contain confidential information — for example,CJ QUIZ: KNOW BEVY OF DP FLUX ALGORITHMS— so we need to\n  keep them secure.\nWe looked through a cryptography textbook for a few minutes, and we learned\n  that it is very hard to factor products of two large prime numbers, so we\n  devised an encryption scheme based on that fact. First, we made some\n  preparations:\nNow, whenever we want to send a pangram as a message, we first remove all\n  spacing to form a plaintext message. Then we write down the product of the\n  prime for the first letter of the plaintext and the prime for the second\n  letter of the plaintext. Then we write down the product of the primes for the\n  second and third plaintext letters, and so on, ending with the product of the\n  primes for the next-to-last and last plaintext letters. This new list of\n  values is our ciphertext. The number of values is one smaller than the number\n  of characters in the plaintext message.\nFor example, suppose thatN= 103 and we chose to use the first 26 odd\n  prime numbers, because we worry that it is too easy to factor even numbers.\n  ThenA= 3,B= 5,C= 7,D= 11, and so on, up toZ= 103.

Your team of\nlinguists has determined that each word in the alien language has an accent on exactly one\nposition (letter) in the word; the part of the word starting from the accented letter is called\nthe accent-suffix. Two words are said to rhyme if both of their accent-suffixes are equal.\nFor example, the wordsPROLandTARPOLrhyme if the accented letter\nin both is theOor theL, but they do not rhyme if the accented\nletters are theRs, or theRinPROLand thePinTARPOL, or theOinPROLand theLinTARPOL.\nYou have recovered a list ofNwords that may be part of an alien poem. Unfortunately,\nyou do not know which is the accented letter for each word. You believe\nthat you can discard zero or more of these words, assign accented letters to the remaining\nwords, and then arrange those words into pairs such that each word rhymes only with the other\nword in its pair, and with none of the words in other pairs.\nYou want to know the largest number of words that can be arranged into pairs in this way.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

Therefore, the largest subset\n  is the empty one, of size 0.\nIn Sample Case #3, we can use the entire set of words if we accentuateCODEJAMandJAMat theJs,HAMandNALAMat their lastAs andHUMandNOLOMat theMs.\nIn Sample Case #4, any two words can be made to rhyme, but always by making the accented letter\n  theI.

We\n  tried to change our line of work by opening up a miniature golf course, but\n  it looks like the gophers have followed us here! Once again, we need to\n  figure out how many gophers there are, but we cannot observe them directly\n  because they are secretive and nocturnal, whereas we like to sleep at night.\n  We do know there are between 1 andMgophers, inclusive.\nOur mini golf course is famous for having a small electronic windmill on each\n  of its 18 holes. The i-th windmill has 2 ≤Bi≤ 18\n  blades, which are numbered from 0 toBi-1, clockwise. Each\n  night, before going to sleep, we turn off the windmills and set each one such\n  that blade 0 is pointing downward, which is important so that the windmills\n  can charge up properly for the next day. However, we have noticed that when\n  we wake up, the windmills have been disturbed. Since our mini golf course is\n  in a windless area, we think the mischievous gophers must be responsible!\nWe know that every night, all of the gophers emerge, one by one; each of them\n  chooses one of the windmills independently and uniformly at random and\n  rotates it counterclockwise by one blade. So, for example, for a windmill\n  with 3 blades for which 0 is pointing downward, the first gopher to interact\n  with it turns it so that 1 is pointing downward, and then the next gophers to\n  interact with that windmill make the downward-pointing blade have number 2,\n  then 0, then 1, and so on.\nWe have devised a plan. We designed our windmills so that we can easily\n  change the number of blades (to modulate the difficulty of our course),\n  and we will now take advantage of this! Each night, before going to sleep, we\n  can choose the number of blades on each of the 18 windmills, within the given\n  limits; we do not have to use the same number of blades on each windmill, or\n  make the same choices every night.

Paper\n  beats Rock and loses to Scissors; Rock beats Scissors and loses to Paper;\n  Scissors beats Paper and loses to Rock.\nWhen two robots face off in a match, the first robot to play a winning\n  move wins. To start, each robot plays the first move of its program. If the\n  two moves are different, one of the moves beats the other and thus one of the\n  robots wins the match. If the moves are the same, each robot plays the next\n  move in its program, and so on.\nWhenever a robot has reached the end of its program and needs its next move,\n  it returns to the start of its program. So, for example, the fifth move of a\n  robot with the programRSSPwould beR. If a match\n  goes on for over a googol (10100) of moves, the judges flip a fair\n  coin to determine the winner.\nOnce a match is over, the winning robot resets, so it has no memory of the\n  that match. In its next match, it starts by playing the first move of its\n  program, and so on.\nThe tournament is played in K rounds and has a single-elimination \"bracket\"\n  structure. There are N = 2Krobots in total, numbered 0 through\n  N - 1. In the first round, robot 0 plays a match against robot 1, robot 2\n  plays a match against robot 3, and so on, up to robots N - 2 and N - 1.

The molecular\nweight of a molecule is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms it contains.\nAs a first step towards figuring out exact molecular weights for the molecules and atomic weights\nfor the two elements, Muriel wants to sort the molecules by strictly increasing molecular weight.\nTo assess the difficulty of that task, she wants to know how many orders are valid\nconsidering only the information she has right now. An ordering of the molecules is considered\nvalid if there exist values for the atomic weights of Codium and Jamarium such that the ordering isstrictlyincreasing in molecular weight.\nTo give an example, we represent each molecule by the ordered pair of the number of\natoms of Codium and Jamarium it contains.

You should make sure you have read the\n  information in theInteractive Problems sectionof our FAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing a single integerTindicating the number of test cases. Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nAt the start of a test case, the judge outputs one line with one integer:\n  the number of the current day. (The judge starts on day 1, and on the\n  i-th day, it prints i.) After your program reads the integer, it should write\n  a line containing two integers V and P, with 1 ≤ V ≤ 20, and\n  0 ≤ P ≤ 100. The judge will interpret these as follows:\nNotice that on turn 100, you must put your own token in, so P must be 100.\nRemember that on the i-th day, for 1 ≤ i ≤ 99, the judge\n  simulates the action of the i-th player, as described in the statement. This\n  happens before your own action on that day.\nAfter you send your move for turn 100, your program should terminate if it\n  was the last test case; otherwise, it should start reading data for the next\n  test case. (Notice that the judge does not tell you whether you got each case\n  correct or incorrect.) The judge will only check whether you have enough\n  correct answers after you have attempted allTtest cases, so you\n  should not stop early! For example, if you answer the first 225 out of 250\n  cases correctly and then exit, or provide malformed input, your solution will\n  not be considered correct.\nIf your program outputs something illegal (e.g., gives an invalid value for P\n  or V, or tries to inspect a vase on turn 100), the judge will send\n  one line containing-1to your input stream, and it will not\n  send any other output after that. If your program continues to wait for the\n  judge after receiving-1, your program will time out, resulting\n  in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have\n  your program exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a\n  Time Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the total memory is exceeded, or your\n  program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\nT= 250.Time limit (for the entire test set): 40 seconds.Memory limit: 1GB.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

Each vertex of the polygon is on\n  exactly two edges.\nChalk folds his napkins by first drawing afolding patternon them. A\n  folding pattern is a set ofK-1 line segments\n  which are drawn on the napkin. Each line segment connects two points with rational\n  coordinates on the border of the polygon defining the napkin and is fully contained\n  in the polygon. No two line segments in a folding pattern may touch or overlap, except possibly at\n  common endpoints. A folding pattern ofK-1 line segments\n  splits the napkin intoKpolygonal regions. Two points\n  are in the same region if there exists some continuous line (not necessarily\n  straight) between them which does not intersect any edge of the polygon or any line segment in\n  the folding pattern — even at endpoints.\nChalk is only interested inneat folding patterns.

However, she is worried that there might be too many stacks,\n  so she intends to remove the L leftmost stacks and the R rightmost stacks,\n  where L and R are nonnegative integers such that L + R ≤S- 3.\n  (Notice that at least 3 stacks of pancakes will remain after the removal.)\nYour supervisor also thinks the remaining stacks will look aesthetically\n  pleasing if they have thepyramid property. A sequence of N stacks\n  of heights H1, H2, ... , HNhas the pyramid\n  property if there exists an integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ N) such that\n  H1≤ H2≤ ... ≤ Hj-1≤ Hjand\n  Hj≥ Hj+1≥ ... ≥ HN-1≥ HN.\n  (It is possible that this sequence might not look much like a typical\n  \"pyramid\" — a group of stacks of the same size has the pyramid\n  property, and so does a group in which the stack heights are nondecreasing\n  from left to right, among other examples.)\nNote that the sequence of stacks remaining after your supervisor removes\n  the L leftmost and R rightmost stacks might not yet have the pyramid\n  property... but you can fix that by adding pancakes to one or more of the\n  stacks! Thepyramidification costof a sequence of stacks is the\n  minimum total number of pancakes that must be added to stacks to give the\n  sequence the pyramid property.\nWhile your manager is carefully deciding which values of L and R to choose,\n  you have started to wonder what the sum of the pyramidification costs over\n  all valid choices of L and R is. Compute this sum, modulo the prime\n  109+7 (1000000007).\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

The optimal strategy for that\n  scenario is to add a single pancake to the middle stack. Although the\n  resulting sequence of stacks looks flat, notice that it has the pyramid\n  property; in fact, any index will work as the j value.In Sample Case #2, here are all possible choices of L and R, the\n  corresponding remaining stacks, and what you should do in each scenario.L = 0, R = 0: H = [1 6 2 5 7]. The optimal solution is to add\n    four pancakes to the third stack and one pancake to the fourth stack. Then\n    we have [1 6 6 6 7], which has the pyramid property with j = 5.L = 0, R = 1: H = [1 6 2 5]. The optimal solution is to add\n    three pancakes to the third stack. Then we have [1 6 5 5], which has the\n    pyramid property with j = 2.L = 0, R = 2: H = [1 6 2]. This already has the pyramid property\n    with j = 2.L = 1, R = 0: H = [6 2 5 7]. The optimal solution is to add\n    four pancakes to the second stack and one pancake to the third stack. Then\n    we have [6 6 6 7], which has the pyramid property with j = 4.L = 1, R = 1: H = [6 2 5]. The optimal solution is to add three\n    pancakes to the second stack. Then we have [6 5 5], which has the pyramid\n    property with j = 1.L = 2, R = 0: H = [2 5 7]. This already has the pyramid property\n    with j = 3.So the answer is (5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 0) modulo (109+ 7), which\n  is 16.In Sample Case #3, we only need to add extra pancakes to create the pyramid\n  property when L = 0 and R = 0. In that case, it is optimal to add 999999999\n  pancakes to each of the second and third stacks. (We hope the diners are\n  hungry!) So the answer is (999999999 + 999999999) modulo\n  (109+ 7) = 999999991.\nIn Sample Case #2, here are all possible choices of L and R, the\n  corresponding remaining stacks, and what you should do in each scenario.\nSo the answer is (5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 0) modulo (109+ 7), which\n  is 16.\nIn Sample Case #3, we only need to add extra pancakes to create the pyramid\n  property when L = 0 and R = 0.

Both\n  N and the kings' coordinates are unknown to you. However, you do know the\n  following things:\nThe kings want to meet in a single cell of the board. If some cell (X, Y)\n  were to be chosen as the meeting cell, then in order to get there, the i-th\n  king would use a number of moves equal to the maximum of the absolute values\n  of the differences of coordinates between its cell and the meeting cell:\n  max(|X-Xi|,|Y-Yi|). The total number of moves used by\n  all kings is thus equal to the sum of those maximums over all values of i.\n  Note that it is not relevant to this problem exactly how the kings move on\n  the board — only the source and destination cells matter, and the\n  number of moves can always be computed using the above formula.\nThis problem has two phases. In the first phase, you may repeatedly do the\n  following: propose a meeting location (A, B) (with each of A and B between\n  -10×Mand 10×M, inclusive), and have the judge tell\n  you the total number of moves the kings would use to get there — the\n  sum (over all i) of max(|Xi-A|,|Yi-B|). You can have at\n  mostRsuch exchanges with the judge, choosing your values of A and\n  B each time. Note that the kings do not actually move, so their locations\n  (Xi, Yi) stay the same for all requests within one test\n  case.\nIn the second phase, the roles are swapped: the judge gives you a meeting\n  cell location (C, D) (with each of C and D between -10×Mand\n  10×M, inclusive), and you must respond with the total number of\n  moves the kings would use to get there, assuming that the kings are in the\n  same locations as in the first phase. There are at mostRsuch\n  exchanges, and you must correctly respond to all of the judge's requests.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially, your program should read a single line containing four integersT,Nmax,MandR: the number of test\n  cases, the maximum number of kings, the maximum absolute value for any\n  coordinate for any king, and the maximum number of requests per phase,\n  respectively. (Note that the values ofMandRare fixed,\n  and are provided as input only for convenience; see the Limits section for\n  more details.) Then, you need to processTtest cases.\nIn each test case, there are two phases. In the first phase, the i-th exchange\n  is as follows:\nYou may initiate at mostRsuch exchanges in this phase. If you make\n  more thanRexchanges, or send a request that the judge can not parse\n  or is out of bounds, the judge responds with one line with a single stringERROR.\nTo end the first phase and switch to the second phase, you must send one line\n  with the stringREADY(the case does not matter), to which the\n  judge responds with the first request of the second phase.\nIn the second phase, the i-th exchange is as follows:\nThe judge is guaranteed to send at least 1 and at mostRsuch\n  requests. If you send an answer that is incorrect or unparseable, the judge\n  responds withERRORas described above. If you answer all of the\n  requests correctly, the judge sends one line with a single stringDONE, at which point your program should initiate the next\n  test case, or terminate with no error if allTtest cases have been\n  handled.\nAfter the judge sends a line withERROR, it does not send any\n  other output.

Marlin's son never moves to a different cell.\nCynthia decided to give Marlin directions in the form of a program consisting\nof a list of instructions, each on a single line. Each instruction is of one of\n5 types:\nAfter executing a line with any of the first 4 instructions, Marlin jumps to the next\nline on the list if there is one.

        "problem_statement": "You recently acquired a new deck of cards. Each card displays a rank, which\n  is an integer between 1 andR, and a suit, which is an integer between\n  1 andS. For each combination of a rank and a suit, there is exactly\n  one card that displays it, meaning that the deck hasR×Scards in total. We will denote a card with rank r and suit s as\n  (r, s).\nBeing brand new, the deck is sorted from top to bottom by suit in increasing\n  order, with ties being broken by ranks in increasing order. That is, (1, 1)\n  comes first, then (2, 1), ..., (R, 1), then (1, 2), (2, 2), ...,\n  (R, 2), and so on up to (R,S). For example, withR= 4 ranks andS= 2 suits, the initial ordering would be:\n  (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2).\nYou want to reorder the deck to be sorted by rank. That is, you want to put\n  all the cards of the same rank together, and have the ranks be in increasing\n  order. You do not care, however, about the order of the suits within each\n  rank. For example, withR= 4 andS= 2, one of the various\n  possible valid new orderings would be: (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1),\n  (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1).\nYou have been learning how to cook, so you want to reorder the deck without\n  putting your spatulas down. You decided to sort the deck using only the\n  following multi-part operation:First, take one or more cards from the top of the deck, and set that\n    selection aside as pile A.Next, take one or more cards from the new top of the deck, and set that\n    selection aside as pile B.Finally, put pile A on top of the deck, and then put pile B on top of\n    the new deck.Notice that the operation exchanges the pile A part of the deck and the pile\n  B part of the deck, without affecting any other cards deeper in the deck (if\n  there are any).Continuing with ourR= 4,S= 2 example, if your first move is\n  to choose 3 cards from the top for pile A and 2 cards for pile B, then these\n  are the cards you get:A: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1),B: (4, 1), (1, 2), andRemainder of deck: (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2).After putting A on the deck and then B on top of that, the new deck is\n  ordered like this:(4, 1), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2).GivenRandS, find a sequence of operations that reorders the\n  deck to be sorted by rank, as described above, and uses the minimum possible\n  number of operations to do so.InputThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Tlines follow.

Each server has a random subset of 10 distinct uppercase English\nletters to use as digits, and a random mapping from those letters to unique values between\n0 and 9.\nThe formal description of the current situation is as follows: each server has adigit stringD composed of exactly 10 different uppercase English letters.\nThe digit string defines the mapping between letters and the base 10 digits:\nD's j-th character from the left (counting from 0) is the base 10 digit of value j.\nFor example, if D wereCODEJAMFUNthenCwould represent\ndigit 0,Owould represent digit 1 andNwould represent\ndigit 9. The number 379009 would be encoded asEFNCCNwhen using that\ndigit string.\nWhen receiving the i-th query with an integer parameter Mi, the server:chooses an integer Niat random from\n    the inclusive range 1 through Mi,writes it as a base 10 string with no leading zeroes using the\nj-th character of D (counting starting from 0) as the digit of value j, andreturns the resulting string as the responseRi.\nWe collected some data that we believe we can use to recover the secret digit string D\nfrom each server. We sent 104queries to each server. For each query, we chose a\nvalue Miat random from the range 1 through 10U- 1,\ninclusive, and received the responseRi, a string of up toUuppercase English letters.\nWe recorded the pairs (Mi,Ri).\nAs we were moving these records to a new data storage device, the\nvalues of all the integers Miwithin the records of some servers became\ncorrupted and unreadable.\nCan you help us find each server's digit string D?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

The other chefs\n  accidentally created some enormous circular pancakes, all of the same size.\n  These pancakes are too large to serve whole, so they have already started to\n  chop them up intoslices(which, in this problem, arecircular sectors).\n  You currently haveNslices, the i-th of which is a sector\n  with an internal (central) angle ofAinanodegrees\n  (a nanodegree is 10-9degrees).\nYou haveDdiners waiting for their food. Each diner wants a single\n  slice that is the same size as every other diner's slice, although they do\n  not care what that size is. But it may not be possible to do this using the\n  current slices, so you may need to make one or more radialcuts.\nA cut changes an existing slice with internal angle X into two new slices\n  with internal angles Y and X - Y. You can do this for any 0 < Y < X,\n  and these values do not need to be integers. You may apply further cuts to\n  either or both of these new slices, and so on.\nIt is OK to have one or more leftover slices (of any size) that are not\n  given to the diners; you can eat those later, since this disaster is making\n  you miss your own breakfast!\nDetermine the smallest total number of cuts you need to make to satisfy the\n  diners.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each case begins with one line containing two\n  integersNandD: the number of slices you currently have and\n  the number of diners. Then, there is one more line containingNintegersA1,A2, ...,AN; the i-th of these represents the internal angle\n  (in nanodegrees) of the i-th slice.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the smallest number of cuts you need, as described above.\nMemory limit: 1GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.1 ≤Ai< 360 × 109, for all i.\nTime limit: 20 seconds.1 ≤N≤ 300.2 ≤D≤ 3.\nTime limit: 20 seconds.1 ≤N≤ 300.2 ≤D≤ 50.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.For exactly 21 cases, 9000 ≤N≤ 10000.For exactlyT-21 cases, 1 ≤N≤ 1000.2 ≤D≤ 50.\nIn Sample Case #1, you only have one tiny slice to start with. The optimal\n  solution is to use one cut to change it into two slices with angles of 1/3\n  nanodegree and 2/3 nanodegrees, and then further cut the latter slice into\n  two more slices with angles of 1/3 nanodegree.\nIn Sample Case #2, you already have two slices of the same size, so you can\n  give those to the two diners, and you do not need to make any cuts.\nIn Sample Case #3, the optimal solution is to cut the slice with internal\n  angle 8 nanodegrees in half. After that operation, you have exactly 3 slices\n  of internal angle 4 nanodegrees, with no leftovers.\nIn Sample Case #4, remember that every diner must receive a single slice.\n  You cannot give one diner the \"3\" slice and the other diner the \"1\" and \"2\"\n  slices, even though the total areas are the same. You must make at least one\n  cut in this case to satisfy the requirements.\n",

(In this specification,Cstands for some program code — not necessarily the same code each time.)\nThis year, we are pleased to announce Emacs++, a text viewer for Lisp++.\n  Emacs++ displays a Lisp++ program of lengthKas a single long line\n  with a cursor that you can move around. The cursor is a \"block cursor\" that\n  is always locatedonone of theKcharacters in the program,\n  rather than between characters.\nAt any point, you can perform one of the following three actions to move the\n  cursor. (i represents the current position of the cursor, counting starting\n  from 1 for the leftmost position.)\nWe think Emacs++ will be simple for power users, but we still need to\n  understand how efficient it is. We have a single Lisp++ program and list ofQqueries about that program; each query consists of a start positionSjand an end positionEj. To answer the j-th query,\n  you must determine the smallest possible amount of time Nj(in\n  seconds) that it will take to take the cursor from positionSjto positionEj, if you make optimal decisions.\nPlease output the sum of all of those Njvalues.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

They would like your help in figuring out what these latency\n  values could be, based on how they saw the update spread in a recent experiment.\nThe Apricot Rules engineers installed the update only on the source computer and then waited\n  for it to propagate throughout the system until every computer was updated. They recorded some\n  information about how the update spread. Specifically, for every computer K other than the\n  source computer, you know exactly one of two things.\nNotice that multiple computers may have received the update at the exact same time.\nYou are required to compute a latency in seconds for each of the direct connections between two\n  computers. Each latency value must be a positive integer no greater than 106. The set\n  of latencies that you provide must be consistent with all of the known information. It is\n  guaranteed that there is at least one consistent way to assign latencies.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\n  Each case begins with one line containing two integersCandD: the number of\n  computers and the number of direct connections, respectively. The computers are numbered from 1 toC, with computer 1 being the source computer.\nThe next line containsC-1 integersX2,X3, ...,XC. A positiveXivalue indicates that computer i received\n  the updateXiseconds after computer 1. A negativeXivalue\n  indicates that -Xiother computers received the update strictly before computer\n  i; this value includes the source computer.\nAfter that, there areDmore lines that represent theDdirect connections in the\n  network. The i-th of these lines contains two integersUiandVi, indicating that computersUiandViare directly connected to each other.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y1y2...\n  yD, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyiis a positive integer not more than 106representing the\n  latency, in seconds, assigned to the i-th direct connection.\nTime limit: 20 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.2 ≤C≤ 100.C- 1 ≤D≤ 1000.1 ≤Ui<Vi≤C, for all i.(Ui,Vi) ≠ (Uj,Vj),\n  for all i ≠ j.All computers (except the source computer) are connected to the source computer through a sequence\n  of one or more direct connections.There exists at least one way of assigning latency values that is consistent with the input.\n-C<Xi< 0, for all i.\n    (You get the second type of information for all computers.)\n-C<Xi≤ 1000, for all i.Xi≠ 0, for all i.\nIn Sample Case #1, the following picture represents the computer network that is illustrated by\n  the sample output. The i-th computer is represented by the circle with the label i. A line\n  linking two circles represents a direct connection. The number on each line represents the\n  latency of the direct connection.\n\nIn Sample Case #2, the first three connections need to have the same latency, while the fourth\n  can have any valid latency. Note that -2, 0, 1000001, and 3.14 are examples of invalid latencies.\nIn Sample Case #3, remember that the connections are bidirectional, and so the update can travel\n  from computer 3 to computer 2. Any two valid latency values work here.\nThe following case could not appear in Test Set 1, but could appear in Test Set 2:\nOne of the correct outputs is10 12 4 15 8 3 9 7 5, as illustrated by the picture\n  below.\n\n",

        "problem_name": "Wormhole in One",
        "problem_statement": "You are participating in an inter-galactic hyperspace golf competition, and\n  you have advanced to the final round! You are really determined to triumph,\n  and so you want to prepare a winning strategy.\nIn hyperspace golf, just as in conventional golf, you hit a ball with a\n  club, which sends the ball in a direction chosen by you. The playing field in\n  hyperspace golf is a 2-dimensional plane with points representing the\n  different holes. The ball is also represented by a point, and you get to\n  choose where the ball starts, as long as it is not in the same place as a\n  hole.\nSince this is hyperspace golf, the players are allowed to turn some pairs of\n  holes into wormholes by linking them together. Each hole can be either left\n  as a normal hole, or linked to at most one other hole (never to itself).\n  Wormholes are undirected links, and can be traversed in either direction.\nBecause the environment is frictionless, when you hit the ball, it moves in\n  a straight direction that it maintains forever unless it reaches a hole;\n  call that hole h. Upon touching hole h, the ball stops if h is not connected\n  to another hole. If h is connected to another hole h', then the ball\n  immediately comes out of h' and continues moving in the same direction as\n  before.\nYou know the location of each hole. You want to maximize the number of\n  distinct holes you can touch with a single hit. With that goal in mind, you\n  want to pick the ball's starting location, the direction in which to send\n  the ball, and which pairs of holes, if any, to link together as wormholes.\n  The ball cannot start in the same place as a wormhole.\n  When the ball goes through a wormhole, both the hole it goes into and the\n  hole it comes out of are counted towards your total. Each hole is only\n  counted once, even if the ball goes into it or comes out of it (or both)\n  multiple times. If the ball stops in a hole, that hole also counts toward\n  your total.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each case begins with one line containing a\n  single integerN: the total number of holes. The followingNlines contain two integers each:XiandYi, representing the X and Y coordinates, respectively, of\n  the i-th hole.\nFor each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is\n  the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of distinct holes\n  you can touch if you make optimal decisions as described above.\nTime limit: 30 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.-109≤Xi≤ 109, for all\n  i.-109≤Yi≤ 109, for all\n  i.(Xi,Yi) ≠ (Xj,Yj),\n    for all i ≠ j. (No two holes are at the same coordinates.)\n1 ≤N≤ 7.\n1 ≤N≤ 100.\nIn Sample Case #1, we can connect the two holes with a wormhole so that we\n  could touch both of them by sending the ball into either one. Notice that\n  without the wormhole, the ball would just stay in the first hole it touches,\n  so it would be impossible to touch more than one hole.\n\nIn Sample Case #2, we can connect the holes at (0, 0) and at (5, 5). We can\n  then hit the ball from position (4.9, 5), for example, in the positive horizontal direction\n  so that it first touches the hole at (5, 5). It goes into that hole and comes out of the\n  hole at (0, 0), retaining its positive horizontal direction of movement. Finally, it\n  touches the hole at (5, 0), and stops (since there is no wormhole linked to that hole).\n\nIn Sample Case #3, we can connect the pair of holes at positions (0, 0) and\n  (5, 0), and also the pair of holes at positions (3, 2) and (5, 5). Hitting\n  the ball from (4, -1) towards the hole at (5, 0) makes it touch the holes at\n  positions (5, 0), (0, 0), (5, 5) and (3, 2), in that order.\n\nIn Sample Case #4, we can connect the pairs of holes at positions (0, 0) and\n  (1, 1), the pair of holes at positions (2, 1) and (11, 2), and also the pair of holes\n  at positions (8, 2) and (14, 2). Hitting\n  the ball from (-1, 0) towards the hole at (0, 0) makes it touch the holes at the following\n  positions, in this order: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (11, 2), (14, 2), (8, 2), (11, 2), (2, 1),\n  and (3, 1). Note that although the holes at positions\n  (11, 2) and (2, 1) are touched twice, they are only counted once each for the answer,\n  since the problem asks for a count of distinct holes.\n\nIn Sample Case #5, there is only one hole, and we can hit the ball into it\n  without needing to consider wormholes at all. (For what it's worth, we can\n  choose any starting location we want, even outside of the allowable range of\n  coordinates for holes.)\n\n",

Cameron wants to name the baby one name\n  (the stringC), whereas Jamie wants to name the baby something else\n  (the stringJ).\nYou want to help them find acompromise namethat is as close as possible\n  to what each of them wants. You think you can do this using the notion ofedit distance.

One way to accomplish the transformation in 5 steps\n  is the following:CAMERONtoJAMERON(change) toJAMIERON(insert) toJAMIEON(delete) toJAMIEN(delete) toJAMIE(delete).\n  Any transformation fromCAMERONintoJAMIErequires at least this many operations.\nTo make the compromise name N as close as possible to the original desires\n  of the parents, you want N to be a non-empty string\n  such that the sum of the edit distances betweenCand N and\n  betweenJand N is as small as possible.\n  Out of all those choices for N, to make sure the compromise is fair,\n  you must choose an N such that the\n  difference between those two edit distances is also as small as possible.\n  Please find a compromise name for Cameron and Jamie.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

However the sum of those distances would be 6, which is not\n  minimal, so it would not be an acceptable answer.\nXZZYis also unacceptable. Its edit distances toCandJ,\n  respectively, are 1 and 3. The sum of those edit distances is minimal, but the difference\n  between the two (|1-3| = 2) is not minimal, since we have shown that it is possible to\n  achieve a difference of 0.\nIn Sample Case #2,YandZare the only acceptable answers.\nIn Sample Case #3, notice that input length restrictions do not apply to the\n  output, so the shown answer is acceptable in either test set.\n  Another possible answer isYYXXY.\nIn Sample Case #4, the edit distance betweenXZXZXZandZYZXis 3, and the edit distance betweenYZandZYZXis 2.\n  The sum of those edit distances is 5, and their difference is 1; these values are\n  optimal for this case.\nThe following additional case could not appear in Test Set 1, but could appear in Test Set 2.\nCase #1: GCis one of the possible correct outputs.\n",

The interaction\n  is organized into rounds.At the beginning of each round, your program must print one line containingTintegers:\n  thei-th integer is the number of the pen you want to try writing with in thei-th test case, or 0 if you do not want to write with any pen in this test case in this\n  round. The pens are numbered from 1 toN.Be aware that flushing the output buffer after each one of these integers, instead of\n  only once after printing allT, could cause a Time Limit Exceeded error because of the\n  time consumed by the flushing itself.The judge responds with one line containingTintegers: thei-th integer is the\n  amount of ink spent in thei-th test case in this round. It will be equal to 1\n  if the writing in thei-th test case was successful.

Notice that the information does\nnot identify repair centers; it gives their locations relative to Principia.\nYou quickly realized that there may be points on the\nmap where this information may not be enough for Principia to uniquely determine its current\nlocation. This is because there might be two (or more) different points from which the\ninformation looks the same. Points with this property are callednon-distinguishable, while\nall other points are calleddistinguishable.\nFormally, the information retrieved by Principia when located at point (x, y)\nis Info(x, y) := the set of all points (z - x, w - y), where (z, w) is the location\nof a repair center and |z - x| + |w - y| ≤D. Here\n|z - x| and |w - y| denote the absolute values of z - x and w - y, respectively.\nA point (x1, y1) is non-distinguishable if and only if\nthere exists another point (x2, y2) such that\nInfo(x1, y1) = Info(x2, y2).\nFor example, supposeD=4 and there are repair centers at points (0, 0) and (5, 0).\nThe point (0, 0) is non-distinguishable because Info(0, 0)={(0, 0)}=Info(5, 0).\nThis means that point (5, 0) is also non-distinguishable. On the other hand,\nInfo(3.5, 0.1)={(-3.5, -0.1), (1.5, -0.1)} is not equal to the information from any other point,\nwhich means that point (3.5, 0.1) is distinguishable. The following picture illustrates the\nregions of distinguishable points (in red) and non-distinguishable points (in blue):\n\nPrincipia is deployed to a point that is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all points\nthat are withinDmeters (using L1distance) of at least one repair center\n— that is, the set of all points (x, y) such that Info(x, y) is non-empty.\nThe probability of that choice belonging to a given continuous set of points S is\nproportional to the number of square meters of S's area.\nIn the example above, each red square has an area of 4.5 square meters, while each blue section\nhas an area of 23 square meters. Therefore, the probability of Principia being deployed within\neach red square is 4.5/(3×4.5 + 2×23) and the probability of it being deployed\nwithin each blue section is 23/(3×4.5 + 2×23). Since the border between adjacent\ndifferently-colored sections has area equal to 0, the probability of Principia being\ndeployed exactly on the border is exactly 0.\nGiven the locations of all repair centers, what is the probability that the point to which\nPrincipia is deployed is distinguishable?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\nEach test case starts with a line containing two integersNandDrepresenting\n(respectively) the number of repair centers and the maximum L1distance from which\nPrincipia can retrieve information from a repair center, as described above. Then,Nlines\nfollow. The i-th of these contains two integersXiandYirepresenting the coordinates of the i-th repair center.

The island's coast is modeled as a circle with a\n  circumference ofKkilometers. There is a lighthouse on the coast\n  which occupies a single point on the circle's circumference. Each point on\n  the coast is mapped to a real number in the range [0,K); formally,\n  point x is the point on the coast that is x kilometers away from the\n  lighthouse when walking clockwise along the coast. For example, ifK= 5, point 0 is the point where the lighthouse is, point 1.5 is the\n  point that is 1.5 kilometers away from the lighthouse in the clockwise direction,\n  and point 2.5 is the point that is located at the diametrical opposite of the\n  lighthouse.\nYou are in charge of studying coastal temperatures. Another team installed a\n  coastal temperature measuring system that works as follows: a number of\n  thermometers were deployed at specific points to measure the temperature at\n  those points. No two thermometers were placed at the same point. In that\n  team's model, points without thermometers are assumed to have the same\n  temperature as the one measured by the closest thermometer. For points that\n  are equidistant from two thermometers, the thermometer in the clockwise\n  direction is used (the first one you would encounter if walking clockwise\n  from the point).\nUnfortunately, you do not know how many thermometers the system used or\n  where they were placed, but you do have access to the system's temperature\n  data. It is given as two lists\n  ofNvalues eachX1,X2, ...,XNandT1,T2, ...,TN, representing that each point x whereXi≤ x <Xi+1is assigned\n  temperatureTi, for each 1 ≤ i <N, and each\n  point x where 0 ≤ x <X1orXN≤ x <Kis assigned temperatureTN.

The i-th such attachment point\n  is at a location that isDinanodegrees (a nanodegree is 10-9degrees) clockwise around the perimeter of the circular harp, starting from the rightmost\n  point on the perimeter.\nNot all attachment points use the same technology to properly fix the cords onto them.\n  The i-th attachment point requires Licentimeters of cord to be used for attaching.\n  A cord fixed between two different attachment points i and j needs to be exactly\n  Li+ Lj+ distance(i, j) centimeters long. By\n  distance(i, j) we mean the length of the geometricchordconnecting the i-th and j-th attachment points, that is, the Euclidean distance between\n  the two points.\nLauren thinks that notes sound better when they come from longer cords. What are theKlongest cords that can be used with Lauren's harp?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. The first line of a test case contains three integers:N,RandK: the number of attachment points,\n  the radius of the circular harp in centimeters, and\n  the number of lengths of cords that Lauren is interested in knowing.\nThe nextNlines describe the attachment points. The i-th of these lines contains\n  two integers,DiandLi, which describe the position (in number of\n  nanodegrees clockwise from the rightmost point of the harp) and length of cord in\n  centimeters needed at the i-th attachment point.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y1y2... yK, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1), andynis the\n  n-th value in the list of lengths of allN×(N-1)/2 cords\n  that can be used in Lauren's harp, sorted in non-increasing order.\nEachynwill be considered correct if it is within an absolute or\nrelative error of 10-9of the correct answer. See theFAQfor an\nexplanation of what that means, and what formats of real numbers we accept.\nTime limit: 120 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.N= 150000 in at most 10 cases.5 ≤N≤ 104in all cases withN≠ 150000.1 ≤R≤ 109.0 ≤D1.Di<Di+1, for all i.DN< 360 × 109.\nLiis chosen independently and uniformly at random between 1 and\n  109, inclusive, for each i.K= 1.\n1 ≤Li≤ 109, for all i.(There is no guarantee as to how each Liis generated.)K= 10.\nThe above cases meet the limits for Test Set 1. Another sample case that does not meet those\n  limits appears at the end of this section.\nNote: theLivalues in these sample cases for Test Set 1 were chosen\n  for ease of understanding and were not randomly generated. Your solution will be run against\n  these sample cases and must pass them.\nIn Sample Case #1, all of the attachment points have the same value, so we should\n  pick the pair connected by the longest chord, which in this case is a horizontal\n  diameter of the circle that has a length of 4 centimeters. So the total length needed is\n  4 + 3 + 3 = 10 centimeters.\nIn Sample Case #2, the fourth and fifth points are extremely close to the third\n  point, but have much smallerLvalues. We can effectively rule them\n  out and focus on the possible connections among the first three points,\n  as follows:first and second points: length 10√2 + 8 + 7: ≈29.142136.first and third points: length ≈19.923894 + 8 + 9: ≈36.923894.second and third points: length ≈12.855726 + 7 + 9: ≈28.855726.Using the first and third points gives us the greatest total length.The following additional case could not appear in Test Set 1, but could appear in Test\n  Set 2.1\n6 1 10\n0 10\n15000000000 1\n30000000000 1\n45000000000 1\n60000000000 1\n75000000000 1The correct output isCase #1: 12.2175228580 12.0000000000 11.7653668647 11.5176380902 11.2610523844 3.0000000000 2.7653668647 2.7653668647 2.5176380902 2.5176380902Notice that there are three possible pairs of points tied for producing the 9th longest cord.

        "problem_statement": "You are trying to organize a group of skiers. The skiers are taking a trip to a\n  large mountain, which has been rented for the day.\nThere areNrest points numbered from 1 toNon the mountain,\n  and they are connected byN-1 slopes. Each slope starts at some rest\n  point and goes directly to another rest point, with no intermediate slopes\n  or rest points. A slope can be traversed in only one direction.\nEach skier starts at the summit rest point and traverses a slope to reach\n  another rest point. From there, the skier can traverse another slope to reach\n  another rest point, and so on. Once a skier reaches their destination rest point,\n  they stop skiing for the day and head to the ski lodge for hot cocoa.\n  The destination rest point cannot be the summit rest point.\n  However, notice that a skier's destination rest point can be the start of zero or more\n  slopes; that is, a skier does not necessarily have to keep using available\n  slopes until there are none available:\n  they can always walk carefully down the rest of the mountain!\n  For all rest points, there is exactly one sequence of slopes that a skier can\n  use to reach it from the summit rest point.\nEach slope can accommodate only a certain total number of skiers in a day, after\n  which the snow gets too choppy to ski. In addition, the ski resort can\n  charge or reward each skier for each slope that they ski on.\n  Each slope may have a different price, and each skier must pay the price\n  for each slope they ski on. A slope's price can be positive, zero, or even\n  negative; a negative price represents a bounty awarded for testing that\n  slope. As the organizer, you pay all the slope prices and collect all\n  the bounties on behalf of your group of skiers.\n  Notice that if multiple skiers use the same slope, you pay that slope's\n  price or collect the slope's bounty multiple times.\n  The sum of all costs you pay minus the sum of all bounties you collect\n  is the total expense for the trip. The expense can be positive, zero,\n  or negative. A negative expense means that you actually made money on the trip!\nAs the organizer, you want to figure out the maximum number of skiers that\n  you can put on the mountain. Also, you would like to figure out the minimum\n  possible expense for a trip with that maximum number of skiers.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.

        "problem_name": "Replace All",
        "problem_statement": "Banana Rocks Inc is coming up with a revolutionary technology to perform the common edit operation\n\"replace all\". Their implementation replaces every occurrence of a character\nwithin a given text with another character. (If the character does not appear in the text, then\nthe operation occurs but has no effect.)\nFor example, if the starting text isCODEJAMWORLDFINALSand an operation is performed to replaceAwithO, the new text would beCODEJOMWORLDFINOLS. If another operation\nis performed on that result to replaceOwithY, the final text\nwould beCYDEJYMWYRLDFINYLS.\nUnfortunately, the implementation is incomplete, so it can only perform replacements from\na specific list ofNpairs of characters. Also, even if a replacement of a specific\ncharacter c1with another character c2is implemented, the reverse\nreplacement of c2with c1may or may not be implemented.\nYou want to try all the implemented replacements. You are given some initial stringSto use as the initial text. You can perform any number of replacements in sequential order:\nthe first replacement is performed onS, and the (i+1)-th replacement is performed\non the result of performing the i-th replacement. The only requirement is that each\nimplemented replacement is performed at least once during this process. There is no upper limit\non how many times you may perform each replacement.\nThe allowed characters are decimal digits and uppercase and lowercase English alphabet\nletters. In this problem, uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter are treated\nas distinct characters.\nWhat is the maximum number of unique characters that can appear in a text that is\nthe result of the last replacement performed?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a stringSand an integerN: the initial text and the number of implemented replacements.\nThe second line containsNtwo-character stringsR1,R2, ...,RN, representing\nthe implemented replacements.AiandBiare the first and second characters ofRi, respectively.\nThe i-th implemented replacement corresponds to replacing all occurrences ofAiwithBi.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y, wherexis the test case number (starting from 1) andyis the maximum number of\nunique characters that can appear in a text that is the result of performing all implemented\nreplacements toSone or more times each, in some order.\nTime limit: 60 seconds per test set.Memory limit: 1GB.1 ≤T≤ 100.2 ≤ length ofS≤ 1000, for all i.Each character ofSis an uppercase or lowercase English alphabet letter or\n  a decimal digit.Aiis an uppercase or lowercase English alphabet letter or\n  a decimal digit, for all i.Biis an uppercase or lowercase English alphabet letter or\n  a decimal digit, for all i.Ai≠Bi, for all i.(Ai,Bi) ≠ (Aj,Bj), for all i ≠ j. (Each replacement is unique.)\n2 ≤N≤ 62.Bi≠Bj, for all i ≠ j.\n2 ≤N≤ 62 × 61.\nThe above cases meet the limits for Test Set 1. Another sample case that does not meet those\n  limits appears at the end of this section.\nSample Case #1 is the one in the statement. Notice that if we perform the replacements in the\n  order mentioned in the statement, we get 13 different characters in the final text. If we perform\n  them both once in the other order, however, we can getCYDEJOMWYRLDFINOLS, which\n  has 14 different characters.\nIn Sample Case #2, one way to get 2 different characters in the final text is to perform\n  the replacements in the order given from left to right, once each.\nIn Sample Case #3, none of the replacements affect the text at all, so it does not matter\n  how we apply them. We will always be left with the original two letters.\n  Notice that replacements can contain characters not appearing in the initial text, and\n  the initial text can contain characters not appearing in the implemented replacements.\nIn Sample Case #4, remember that uppercaseBis not the same character as\n  lowercaseb.\nThe following additional case could not appear in Test Set 1, but could appear in Test Set 2.\nThe correct output isCase #1: 4.\nIn this additional sample case, one possibility is to perform the replacements in the\n  following order:X3 2X X2 2X 12 31. This process goes through the\n  following strings, starting withS:1234 1234 1X34 1234 1X34 2X34 2X14.\n",

        "problem_statement": "You want to sort N} distinct items, x_1, x_2, ..., x_N}. Unfortunately, you do not have\na way of comparing two of these items. You only have a way to, given three of them, find\nout which one is the median, that is, which one is neither the minimum nor the maximum among\nthe three.\nFor example, suppose N} = 5 and you know that:x_1 is the median of \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}x_2 is the median of \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}x_3 is the median of \\{x_3, x_4, x_5\\}\nThen, it is guaranteed that the sorted order of the elements is either\nx_4, x_2, x_1, x_3, x_5 or its reverse x_5, x_3, x_1, x_2, x_4.\nNotice that by knowing only medians, it is impossible to distinguish the order of any list\nfrom its reverse, since the median question has the same result for any three\nelements in both cases.\nYour program will have to find the order of T} lists of N} elements using at most\nQ} median questions in total (or Q} / T} queries per list on average).\nIn each case, finding either the right order or its reverse is considered correct.\nThe order for each case is generated uniformly at random from all possible orders,\nand independently of any other information.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially, the judge will send you a single line containing three integers T}, N}, and\n  Q}: the number of test cases, the number of elements to sort within each test case, and\n  the total number of questions you are allowed across all test cases, respectively.\n  Then, you must process T} test cases. Each test case consists of a series of question exchanges\n  plus an additional exchange to provide the answer.\nFor a question exchange, your program must print a single line containing\n  three distinct integers i, j, k all between 1 and N}, inclusive,\n  which corresponds to asking the judge\"which element is the median of the set\n  \\{x_i, x_j, x_k\\}?\"The judge will respond with a single line containing a single integer L},\n  meaning that the median of that set is x_L} (L} is always equal to\n  one of i, j, or k).\n  If you try to perform a (Q}+1)-th question exchange, the judge will simply output-1.\nOnce you are ready to state the result, print a line containing N} integers\n  representing the indices of the elements in sorted or reverse sorted order.\n  The judge will respond with a single integer1if your answer\n  is correct or-1if it is not. After receiving the judge's answer for the\n  T}-th case, your program must finish in time in order to not receive a Time Limit Exceeded\n  error. In addition, if you print additional information after receiving the result\n  for the T}-th case, you will get a Wrong Answer judgment.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted line or invalid values from your\n  program at any moment, the judge will print a single number-1.\n  After the judge prints-1for any of the reasons explained above,\n  it will not print any further output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a-1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program\n  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\nTime limit: 40 seconds.Memory limit: 1 GB.T} = 100.\nN} = 10.Q} = 300 * T}.\nN} = 50.Q} = 300 * T}.\nN} = 50.Q} = 170 * T}.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform.

        "problem_statement": "Note: The main parts of the statements of the problems \"Reversort\" and \"Reversort Engineering\" are\nidentical, except for the last paragraph. The problems can otherwise be solved independently.\nReversort is an algorithm to sort a list of distinct integers in increasing order.\nThe algorithm is based on the \"Reverse\" operation. Each application of this\noperation reverses the order of some contiguous part of the list.\nThe pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:\nAfter i-1 iterations, the positions 1,\\;2,\\;\\dots,\\;i-1 of the list\ncontain the i-1 smallest elements of L, in increasing order.\nDuring the i-th iteration, the process reverses the sublist going\nfrom the i-th position to the current position of the i-th minimum\nelement. That makes the i-th minimum element end up in the i-th position.\nFor example, for a list with 4 elements, the algorithm would perform 3 iterations.\nHere is how it would process L = [4, 2, 1, 3]:i = 1,~ j = 3 \\longrightarrow L = [1, 2, 4, 3]i = 2,~ j = 2 \\longrightarrow L = [1, 2, 4, 3]i = 3,~ j = 4 \\longrightarrow L = [1, 2, 3, 4]The most expensive part of executing the algorithm on our architecture is the Reverse operation.\nTherefore, our measure for the cost of each iteration is simply the length of the sublist passed\nto Reverse, that is, the value j - i + 1.

You need to decide where to place\neach block before getting to see any of the upcoming blocks, and once placed,\nblocks cannot be moved.\nEach block has a single decimal digit printed on it, and towers are built such that the faces with\ndigits are all facing the front. The font is such that blocks cannot be rotated to obtain\na different digit (for example, a block with a 6 on it cannot\nbe rotated to obtain a block with a 9 on it, nor vice versa).\nFor example, suppose N}=3 and B}=3 and you currently have towers as shown in Picture 1.\nIf a block with a 6 shows up next, you have two options: either place it on\ntop of the tower with only two blocks (as shown in Picture 2)\nor start the third tower (as shown in Picture 3). Note that you cannot put it on top of the first\ntower since the first tower already has B} blocks.\nPicture 1\nPicture 2\nPicture 3\nAfter the building is done, we read the B} digit integer\nprinted on the front of each tower from the top to the bottom (that is, the digit on\nthe last block placed on a tower is the most significant digit). Notice that these\nintegers may have any number of leading zeroes.\nThen, we add those N} integers together to obtain the score of our building operation.\nFor example, in Picture 4 below, the integers read on each tower, from left to right,\nare 123, 345, and 96. The score of that building operation would\nbe 123 + 345 + 96 = 564.\nPicture 4\nThe digit for each block is generated uniformly at random, and independently of\nany other information.\nIn order for your solution to be judged correct, the sum of its scores over all T} test cases\nmust be at least P}.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the\n  information in the Interactive Problems section of ourFAQ.\nInitially the judge will send you a single line containing four integers T}, N},\n  B}, and P}: the number of test cases, the number of towers,\n  the number of blocks in each tower, and the minimum total score you need to reach to\n  pass this test set.\nThen, you must process T} test cases. Each test case consists of N} \\times B}\n  exchanges. Each exchange corresponds to placing one block.\n  Within each exchange, the judge will first print a line containing a single integer\n  D} representing the digit printed on the block you need to place.\n  You need to respond with a single line containing a single integer i}, the number\n  (between 1 and N}) of the tower you want to place that block on.\nAfter the last exchange of each test case except the last one, the judge will\n  immediately start the next test case. After the last exchange of the last test case,\n  the judge will print an additional\n  line containing a single integer:1if your total score\n  is at least P} or-1if it is not.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted line, an invalid tower number,\n  or the number of a tower that already contains B} blocks from your\n  program, the judge will print a single number-1.\n  After the judge prints-1for any of the reasons explained above,\n  it will not print any further output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a-1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program\n  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\nYou can assume that the digit for each block is generated uniformly at random, and independently\n  for each digit, for each test case and for each submission.Therefore\n  even if you submit exactly the same code twice, the judge could use different random digits.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.Memory limit: 1 GB.T} = 50.N} = 20.B} = 15.D} is a decimal digit between 0 and 9.\nP} = 860939810732536850 (approximately 8.6 \\times 10^{17}).Note that this boundary is chosen as approximately 90\\% of T} \\times S, where\nS = 19131995794056374.42...

You can rearrange the list by swapping the contents of any two positions\n(they do not need to be adjacent). Unfortunately, you cannot read those contents directly.\nYou can access information about the list contents by querying the minimum of a range.\nThe minimum query gives you\nthepositionof the minimum value over a range of consecutive positions.\nFor example, in the list [51, 33, 100, 11], the minimum over the range between\npositions 2 and 4, inclusive (1-based), is at position\n4 and the minimum between positions 1 and 3 is at position 2.\nQueries about the minimum within a range are limited by a coin budget per test case.\nLarger ranges are cheaper: asking about the position of the minimum\nbetween positions i and j (for i < j)\ncosts \\lceil 10^8 / (j - i + 1) \\rceil coins, where \\lceil x \\rceil is\nthe smallest integer greater than or equal to x (that is, x rounded up).\nSwap operations, on the other hand, do not cost any coins.\nWrite a program that sorts lists of integers using any number of swaps and at most\n6 \\times 10^8 coins per test case distributed among any number of minimum queries.\nThis is an interactive problem.

The judge has the initial lists preset before it gets any input\n  from your program, and the only changes done to them during the exchanges with\n  your program are the swaps that you request.\nThen, you must process T} test cases. Each test case consists of a series of exchanges\n  plus an additional line indicating you are done. Each exchange consists of you printing\n  one line and the judge printing one line in response.\n  Your program must print a single line containing one of these options:\nAfter the judge responds1to aD, it will finish\n  if it was the last test case or it will immediately start waiting for your first\n  command for the next test case. After receiving the judge's response for the\n  T}-th case, your program must finish in order to not receive a Time Limit Exceeded\n  error.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted line or invalid values from your\n  program at any moment, including a minimum operation whose cost would exceed\n  your remaining budget for the test case, the judge will print a single number-1.\n  After the judge prints-1for any of the reasons explained above,\n  it will not print any further output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a-1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error.

Specifically, your enjoyment value for eating the entire i⁠-⁠th patch\nof icing is A_i}, and your twin's is B_i}. If someone eats part of a patch, they get\nenjoyment proportional to the eaten area. For example, if you eat\n\\frac{2}{3} of the area of the i⁠-⁠th icing patch, you would get\n\\frac{2A_i}}{3} enjoyment from it.\nNote that there may be some flavors of icing that you or your twin do not enjoy, so the A_i}\nand/or B_i} values can be negative.\nYou will cut the cake into two rectangular pieces by making a single vertical cut\n(parallel to the Y-axis). After cutting the cake, you will eat the left piece and your twin will\neat the right piece.\nYour total enjoyment is the sum of the enjoyment you get from all icing to the left of the cut.\nSimilarly,\nyour twin's enjoyment is the sum of the enjoyment they get from all icing to the right of the cut.\nTo be as fair as possible, you want to cut the cake such that\nthe absolute value of the difference between your total enjoyment and your twin's total enjoyment\nis as small as possible.\nGiven the N} triangular icing patches on a rectangular cake, what is the minimum possible\nabsolute value of the difference between your and your twin's total enjoyments\nyou can get?\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}.

Additionally, the state is already fun, so even if there were\nadditional disabled slides, enabling anything would result in a not fun state.\nAfter the fourth operation, there are\ntwo disabled slides, but enabling either would not yield a fun state.\nAll slides are initially disabled, then Sult performs its operations one at a time.\nAfter each of Sult's operations, determine which disabled slide, if any, Melek can enable\nto put the slides in a fun state.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}.

Printing a D in the Code Jam red uses 0 units of cyan ink, 500000 units of magenta\nink, 450000 units of yellow ink, and 50000 units of black ink.\nTo print a color, a printer must have at least the required amount of ink for each of its 4 color cartridges.\nGiven the number of units of ink each printer has in each cartridge, output any color, defined as\n4 non-negative integers that add up to 10^6, such that all three printers have enough\nink to print it.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}.

In their design, a network consists of M} machines numbered from 1 to\n  M}, and each pair of machines is connected by a direct link. Each of the links is given a unique\n  integer priority value between 1 and (M} \\times (M} - 1) / 2) and each machine routes traffic according\n  to those priorities.\nUnfortunately, the routing algorithm is too aggressive and will route all traffic from a machine\n  through the highest priority link connected to it. This may make some groups of machines\n  isolated from others.\nFormally, we say that a machine m uses a link \\ell if (and only if) \\ell is the highest\n  priority link connected to m. We also say that a link isactiveif it is used by at\n  least one of the two machines it connects. Given the link priorities, the original network becomes\n  partitioned into disjoint intranets. Two machines belong to the same intranet if and only if there\n  is some path between them using only active links.\n\nFor example, as seen in the left image above, only the links with priorities 6 and 5\n  are active. This creates two disjoint intranets. However, in the example on the right, three links\n  are active, which results in one intranet consisting of all 4 machines.\nAs part of the quality assurance team at Apricot Rules LLC, you are investigating the extent\nof the problem.

        "problem_statement": "As punishment for being naughty, Dante has been trapped in a strange house with many rooms.\nThe house is an N} \\times N} grid of rooms, with N} odd and greater than 1. The\nupper left room is numbered 1, and then the other rooms are numbered\n2, 3, ..., N}^2, in a clockwise spiral pattern. That is, the numbering proceeds\nalong the top row of the grid and then makes a 90 degree turn to the right whenever a grid boundary\nor an already numbered room is encountered, and finishes in the central room of the grid. Because\nN} is odd, there is always a room in the exact center of the house, and it is always numbered\nN}^2.\nFor example, here are the room numberings for houses with N} = 3 and N} = 5:\n\nDante starts off in room 1 and is trying to reach the central room (room N}^2).\nThroughout his journey, he can only make moves from his current room to higher-numbered, adjacent\nrooms. (Two rooms must share an edge — not just a corner — to be adjacent.)\nDante knows that he could walk from room to room in consecutive numerical order — i.e., if he\nis currently in room x, he would move to room x+1, and so on. This would take\nhim exactly N}^2 - 1 moves. But Dante wants to do things his way! Specifically, he wants to\nreach the central room in exactly K} moves, for some K} strictly less than N}^2 - 1.\nDante can accomplish this by taking one or moreshortcuts. A shortcut is a move between\nrooms that are not consecutively numbered.\nFor example, in the 5 \\times 5 house above,If Dante is at 1, he cannot move to 17, but he can move to 2 or to\n    16. The move to 2 is not a shortcut, since 1 + 1 = 2.

Goro can do this so accurately that exactly one ball\n  falls into each box. A ball may fall into the same box it came out of, or\n  into a different one.\nBetter yet, Goro also has the ability to assign colors to boxes before\n  each bump. Then, he can bump the table in such a way that balls coming out of\n  a box of color c always fall into a box of color c. As impressive\n  as this accuracy is, Goro does not have any more control than that. Within each color,\n  balls end up assigned to boxes at random.\n\nFor example, suppose the balls appear in the order 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 2 (as seen above).

The nodes of the tree are numbered 1 through N}.\n  Each line must represent a distinct edge of the tree with 2 integers between\n  1 and N}: the two vertices the edge connects.\n  The edges must represent a tree.\n  The two integers within a line may be in either order, and the N}-1 lines themselves may\n  be in any order.\nAfter that, your program must read a line containing a single integer M}, the number of games\n  that you need to play on this tree. These games are played independently; in other words,\n  all vertices of the tree are blue at the start of each game.\nFor each of the M} games, you need to process some number of exchanges until the game is\n  over. Each exchange consists of a turn from each player.\nFor each exchange, your program must read two lines describing Ueli's turn first.\n  The first of those lines will contain an\n  integer K}, denoting the number of blue vertices to be colored red.\n  The second of those lines will contain K} distinct integers A_1}, A_2}, ..., A_K}\n  describing the blue vertices to be colored red. K} will be at least 1, and each A_i}\n  will be between 1 and N}, inclusive. Vertices A_2}, A_3}, ..., A_K} will all be\n  neighbors of vertex A_1}.\nAfter that, your program must output Vreni's choice for their turn in the same format:\n  the first line with the number of blue vertices to be colored red, followed by the second\n  line with the numbers of those vertices, in such an order that all vertices\n  except the first one are neighbors of the first one.\nIf all vertices are red after Vreni's turn, it means that Vreni has won and this game is over.\n  The next game starts immediately if there is one. If this was the last game for this test case,\n  then the next test case starts immediately if there is one. If this was the last test case,\n  the judge will send no further input to your program, and the program must send no further output.\nOn the other hand, if all vertices are red after Ueli's move,\n  it means that Vreni has lost and therefore your program did not pass the test case.\n  In this case, instead of starting a new exchange by printing the last move\n  that colors all remaining blue vertices red, the judge will print a single number -1\n  and will not print any further output, and will not process any further games or test cases.\nIf the judge receives an invalidly formatted or invalid line (like outputting an\n  unexpected number of integers, or integers out of range, or outputting a set of edges\n  that do not form a tree, or trying to color a vertex\n  that is already red, or trying to color a vertex that is not a neighbor of the first\n  vertex colored in this turn) from your program at any moment, the judge\n  will also print a single number -1 and will not print any further output.\n  If your program continues to wait for the judge after\n  receiving a -1, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program\n  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit\n  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program\n  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\nThe judge is deterministic. In other words, if you make two attempts that print the\n  same numbers, you will get the same inputs from the judge. However, of course the judge can make\n  different moves in different games on the same tree.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 <= M} <= 50.\nT}=1.N}=30.\n1 <= T} <= 10.31 <= N} <= 40.No two test cases use the same value of N}.\nYou can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test\n  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can\n  use ourinteractive runnerfor that. For more information, read the instructions in comments in that\n  file, and also check out theInteractive Problems sectionof the FAQ.\nInstructions for the testing tool are included in comments within the tool.\n  We encourage you to add your own test cases.

        "problem_statement": "The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this problem statement are\nfictitious. No identification with actual persons is intended or should be inferred.\nIt is 1935 and a meeting between two Nobel prize winners is producing astonishing results.\nSchrödinger, a famous physicist, invited Pavlov, a famous physiologist, to see his experiments\nwith cats in boxes. Pavlov brought his dog with him to keep up with his own\nresearch, and the combination proved interesting, to say the least.\nSchrödinger had a row of N} boxes. Some boxes definitely contain a cat, some boxes definitely\ndo not contain a cat, and some boxes may or may not contain a cat. Each box is only big enough\nto hold a single cat. Each box is also equipped with a special quantum tunnel, that allows\nthe cat in the box to move to some other specific box if the destination was empty. The tunnels\nwork in a single direction.\nCats are usually mellow and quiet and do not use the tunnels unless they become startled. When a\nthird unannounced guest rings the bell, Pavlov's dog gets excited immediately and starts\nrunning and barking. The dog starts at box 1 and runs towards box N}. \nAs the dog runs, it passes right next to each box, one at a time. When\nit passes next to a box that contains a cat, the cat in that box becomes startled. The\nstartled cat checks the available tunnel and, if the destination box is empty, uses it to escape.\nIf the destination box is occupied, the cat stays in its current box. The same cat can be startled\nmore than once if they move to a box the dog will get to afterwards, and will proceed in the same\nway every time it is startled (using only the newly available tunnel each subsequent time).\n\nAfter Pavlov's dog finally stops right next to the last box, Pavlov asks Schrödinger whether\nthere is a cat in that last box. Schrödinger, true to his fame, replies that he does not know.\nPavlov notices that the answer may depend on whether or not there were cats in the unknown boxes.\nMoreover, he also notices that because there are k unknown boxes, there are 2^k\npossibleinitial configurations, one for each combination of statuses of the unknown\nboxes. Pavlov tells Schrödinger that they should try to calculate how\nmany of the 2^k initial configurations would result in having a cat in the last box. You are\nasked to recreate that calculation. Since the output can be a really big number, we only ask you to\noutput the remainder of dividing the result by the prime 10^9+7 (1000000007).\nNeither cats, nor dogs, nor Nobel prize winners were harmed in the making of this problem\n  statement.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}. T} test cases follow, each\ndescribed by exactly three lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer\nN}, the number of boxes in Schrödinger's experiment. Boxes are numbered between 1\nand N}, in the order Pavlov's dog passes them by. The second line of a test case\ncontains a single string S} of N} characters. The i-th character of S} (counting\nfrom left to right) represents the contents of box i: it is an\nuppercase 'C' if the box contains a cat, a period '.' if the\nbox does not contain a cat and a question mark '?' if it is unknown whether\nthe box contains a cat or not. The third line of a test case contains N} integers\nB_1}, B_2}, ..., B_N}, representing that there is a tunnel going out of box i\nand into box B_i}, for all i.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y,\nwhere x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of initial\nconfigurations that would result\nin a cat being in the last box and unable to escape despite hearing the barking, modulo the prime\n 10^9+7 (1000000007).\nTime limit: 10 seconds.Memory limit: 1 GB.1 <= T} <= 1234.the length of S} = N}.Each character of S} is either an upper case 'C', a period '.' or\n  a question mark '?'.1 <= B_i} <= N}, for all i.B_i} != i, for all i.\n1 <= N} <= 100.i - 5 <= B_i} <= i + 5, for all i.\n  (All tunnels connect to nearby boxes.)\n1 <= N} <= 5000.\nSample Case #1 is illustrated in the problem statement. There are 4 possible configurations:...C: the dog runs through the first 3 boxes without changing anything\n  because there is no cat there. Then, when it gets to the last box, the cat hears it and escapes\n  to box 3. Therefore, there is no cat in the last box in this case.C..C: when the dog barks near box 1, that startles the cat that\n  goes through the tunnel to get to box 2, which was empty. Then, the same cat\n  gets startled again when the dog barks near box 2 and gets to box 3. And when\n  the dog barks next to box 3, the cat hears it and returns to box 1. Therefore,\n  when the dog gets to box 4 and the other cats hears it, box 3 is empty so the\n  cat escapes and the last box ends up empty..C.C: This case is very similar to the previous one. After the dog goes through\n  the first box and nothing happens, the state is the same as before, so the ultimate result\n  is the same: last box empty.CC.C: In this case, the cat in the first box cannot escape when it hears the\n  dog, so it remains in box 1. Then, when the cat in box 2 gets startled it escapes to\n  box 3 leaving a state ofC.CC. When the dog gets to the box 3, the cat\n  currently there cannot escape to box 1 so the state remains the same. Finally, when the\n  dog gets to the last box, the cat that is there cannot escape because box 3 is occupied\n  this time. So, in this case, the last box ends up with a cat after the dog ends its journey.Out of the 4 possibilities, only 1 (the last one) ends up with a cat in the last box,\n  so the answer is 1.\nIn Sample Case #2, the tunnels are set up the same as in Sample Case #1. Since no tunnel ends\n  at the last box, the configurations that start with no cat at the last box will also not end with\n  a cat there, so we do not need to count them. Then, we have 8 additional configurations. The\n  4 we considered for Sample Case #1, out of which only 1 ends up with a cat at the last\n  box. The remaining 4 configurations are:..CC,C.CC,.CCC,CCCC. From these additional 4 configurations, only in the\n  last one listed a cat ends up in the last box, for a total of 2 overall.\nIn Sample Case #3, notice that for a cat to remain in the last box after the dog barks near it,\n  both that box and box 5 must be occupied then (otherwise, either there is no cat in the\n  last box, or it will escape to box 5). Since there is no tunnel going into box 5,\n  a cat must start there. As long as there is another cat in any other box, box 6 will get\n  (or remain) occupied before the cat in box 5 gets an opportunity to escape, so all of those\n  will end up with a cat in the last box. As we argued before, a single cat is not enough. Thus,\n  we need to count the number of configurations with a cat in box 5 and at least one other cat.\n  There are 2^4 configurations with a cat in box 5, and out of those, only 1 has\n  no other cat, so the answer is 2^4-1=15.\nIn Sample Case #4, in all of the 2^k ways in which the k unknown boxes may exist\n  a cat would be left in the last box.\n",

        "problem_statement": "Alice is trapped in Wonderland's labyrinth, being chased by the Queen of Hearts and her\nherald! The labyrinth is a set of J} junctions numbered 1 through J},\nconnected by C} bidirectional corridors.\nAlice and the Queen of Hearts take turns making moves, and each knows the location of the other\nat all times. A move (by either of them) consists of either staying at the current junction or moving to\nanother one that is connected to it by a corridor.\nThe Queen's herald, however, announces the next move the Queen makes in advance. That means\nthat before anyone makes a move, he announces the Queen's first move. Then, Alice moves first.\nThen, each time the Queen moves, she must respect the previous announcement, and then decide\nher next move so the herald can announce it. Alice hears the announcements, so she always knows the\nQueen's next move before making her own.\n\nIf Alice and the Queen are at the same junction after either of them moves, then Alice is caught.\nOtherwise, the pursuit continues. After 10^9 total moves (half of them for Alice and half\nfor the Queen), if Alice and the Queen are not in the same junction, then the Queen will give up\nand Alice will be safe.\nAlice chooses her moves optimally to escape. If she cannot escape, she chooses her moves to\nmaximize the total number of moves until she is caught. The Queen chooses her moves optimally\nto try to catch Alice in as few total moves as possible.\nGiven the labyrinth's layout and the initial locations of both the Queen and Alice,\nfind out whether Alice will be caught by the Queen and, if so, in how many moves.\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T}. T} test cases follow.\nEach test case starts with a line containing four integers J}, C}, A}, and Q}: the\nnumber of junctions, the number of corridors, the junction where Alice starts, and the junction\nwhere the Queen starts, respectively. Then,\nC} lines follow. The i⁠-⁠th of these lines contains two integers\nU_i} and V_i}, indicating that the i⁠-⁠th corridor bidirectionally connects junctions\nU_i} and V_i}.\nFor each test case, output one line containingCase #x: y,\nwhere x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y isSAFEif Alice can avoid being caught for 10^9 total moves. Otherwise, y is the total number of\nmoves (including Alice's and the Queen's) that it takes for the Queen to catch Alice.\nMemory limit: 1 GB.1 <= T} <= 100.1 <= A} <= J}.1 <= Q} <= J}.A} \\ne Q}.1 <= U_i} < V_i} <= J}, for all i.(U_i}, V_i}) \\ne (U_j}, V_j}), for all i \\ne j.\nTime limit: 10 seconds.2 <= J} <= 30.1 <= C} <= 60.\nTime limit: 60 seconds.2 <= J} <= 10^5.1 <= C} <= 2 \\times 10^5.\nSample Case #1 is the one pictured in the problem statement. Alice's optimal first move is to move\n  to junction 4.\nSample Case #2 is the same as Sample Case #1 but the Queen starts at junction 2. The Queen\n  can catch Alice by first announcing a move to junction 4. If Alice were to move to junction\n  4⁠, she would be caught in 2 moves. Alice can evade capture for an\n  extra 2 moves by staying put and waiting until the Queen then moves to junction 5 where she is\n  located.\n\nIn Sample Case #3, the Queen cannot reach Alice no matter what she does.\n\nIn Sample Case #4, the Queen can begin by announcing that she will move to Alice's current\n  junction. Alice has to move before then. If Alice moves to where the Queen already is, she gets\n  caught immediately; if Alice remains in place, then she gets caught when the Queen moves. The\n  second option is better, since it requires 2 total moves (Alice's and the Queen's) instead of\n  1.\n\n",
